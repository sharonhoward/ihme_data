BC_1738_EMONTAGU_MB_1	Madam I   think   I   cannot   possibly   show   a   greater   regard   to   your Grace's   commands   than   by   obeying   them   in   the   stricktest   sense , therefore   as   you   order'd   me   to   write   to   you   soon ,   I   have   wrote the   soonest   that   was   possible ,   if   you   think   I   need   not   have wrote   this   week   or   fortnight ,   all   I   desire   is   that   you   would put   the   letter   in   your   pocket   without   reading   for   a   few   days so   I   will   not   date   it ,   but   leave   that   to   your   pleasure . I   arrived   at   Mount   Morris   rather   more   fond   of   society   than Solitude ;   I   thought   it   no   very   agreable   change   of   Scene   from Handel ,   &   Gafferelli ,   to   Woodlarks ,   &   nightingales ,   it   seems to   me   to   be   something   like   the   different   Seasons   of   Youth   & Age ,   first   noise   &   publick   show ,   &   then   after   being   convinced That   is   Vanity ,   retire   to   Shades   &   Solitude ,   which   we   soon find   to   be   Vexation   of   Spirit ;   I   think   Solomon   was   in   the wrong   when   he   said   all   was   vanity   &   Vexation   of   Spirit ,   he ought   to   have   said   all   was   vanity   or   vexation   of   Spirit ,   for the   one   succeeds   the   other   as   darkness   does   light ,   & especially   in   the   Women ,   the   young   Maid   is   all   Vanity ,   &   the Old   one   all   vexation ;   the   same   cheek   which   when   blooming   was the   Woman's   vanity ,   when   wrinkled   becomes   her   vexation ;   but every   thing   has   its   use ,   were   it   not   for   wrinkles   what   prudent maxim   should   we   lose   which   now   instruct   us !   What   scandal   which diverts   us !   for   Old   Maids   have   nothing   to   do   but   to   show   their own   prudence   and   other   Peoples   follies .   You   see   how sententious   I   am   grown   only   by   a   fortnights   retirement   from the   world ;   when   the   world   has   left   me   to   be   sure   I   shall   speak only   in   Proverbs .   for   if   these   things   are   done   in   a   Green   tree what   shall   be   done   in   a   dry !   My   Correspondents   in   Town   tell   me it   is   very   hot   &   disagreable ,   but   I   know   your   Grace   to   be   a Person   of   that   great   patience ,   as   to   be   able   to   endure   a Midsummer   Sun   in   London ,   so   I   won't   send   you   any   Compliments of   Condolence   upon   your   being   still   there ,   tho   to   be   sure   tis a   most   terrible   thing   to   be   obliged   to   walk   in   the   Park   in   an Evening   when   'tis   so   full   of   company   one   can   scarce   stir .   Sir Francis   Dashwood's   Sister   is   going   to   be   married   to   Sir   Robert Austin   a   Baronet   of   our   Country ,   if   the   size   of   his   Estate bore   any   proportion   to   the   bulk   of   his   Carcass   he   would   be   one of   the   greatest   Matches   in   England ,   but   unhappily   for   her   the first   is   as   remarkably   small   as   the   other   is   large ,   so   all   she is   to   get   for   Six   thousand   is   a   fat   Man ,   a   lean   Estate ,   &   a trumpery   title ,   indeed   a   Lady   may   make   her   Lover   languish   till he   is   the   size   she   most   likes ,   if   she   should   waste   him   an   ell in   circumference   he   would   be   almost   as   slim   a   Man   as   Sir   John Cotton ,   at   present   you   would   take   him   for   a   Descendent   of   Gog , or   Magog ,   as   it   is   not   now   the   fashion   for   Men   to   dye   for love ,   the   only   thing   a   Woman   can   do   to   give   herself   a reputation   is   to   bring   a   Man   into   a   Consumption ,   what   triumph then   must   attend   the   lady   who   reduces   Sir   Robert   Austin   to Asses   Milk !   Queen   Omphale   made   Hercules   spin ,   but   greater glory   waits   the   Lady   who   makes   Sir   Robert   Austin   lean .   as   for Miss   Dashwood   I   think   she   has   nothing   destructive   in   her   look , I   believe   she   must   bring   him   only   to   a   moderate   size   while   he is   a   Lover ,   &   reduce   the   rest   when   she   is   married ,   for   I   have known   some   Women   who   could   make   a   Mans   heart   as   much   after marriage   as   before . I   hope   your   Grace   will   favour   me   with   a   letter ,   for   to write   to   you   from   here   would   be   extreamly   like   Swifts   Country Post   of   news   from   the   henroost   & c   unless   I   had   now   &   then something   from   you   to   enable   me   to   fill   my   paper . I   told   my   Pappa   how   much   he   laid   under   your   Graces displeasure   for   hurrying   out   of   Town ,   but   what   is   a   fine Ladies   Anger   or   the   Loss   of   London   to   five   and   forty !   They   are more   afraid   of   an   Easterly   wind   than   a   frown   when   they   are   at that   age .   My   Mamma   &   Sister   desire   their   complimts   I   hope   the Marquiss   of   Tichefield   is   well .   I   desire   my   Hble   Service   to my   Lord   Duke   &   I   am   Madam Your   Most   Hble   Servt E Robinson 
BC_1738_EMONTAGU_MB_2	Hatch     . Madam Your   Grace's   very   entertaining   letter   was   sent   me   to   Sir Wyndham   Knatchbulls ,   where   I   have   been   about   three   weeks ,   & propose   returning   to   Mount   Morris   in   a   few   days .   I   am   as   angry as   I   dare   be   with   your   Grace ,   that   you   did   not   send   me   any account   of   those   charming   fireworks ,   which   I   fancy   were   the prettiest   things   that   ever   were   seen ,   but   you   never   tell   me any   thing   you   do   at   Bullstrode . I   very   much   approve   your   love   of   variety   in   triffles ,   & constancy   in   things   of   greater   moment ,   I   think   you   have   great reason   to   think   exchange   robbery ,   tho   the   common   saying   is   to the   contrary ,   for   my   part   who   never   saw   one   Man   yet   that   I loved ,   I   scarce   imagine   I   could   be   fond   of   a   dozen ,   &   come   to that   degree   of   unreasonableness   so   ridiculously   set   forth   in Hyppolito   in   the   Tempest ;   at   present   I   seldom   like   above   six or   eight   at   a   time ;   I   fancy   in   Matrimony   one   finds   variety   in one ,   in   the   charming   vicissitudes   of   sometimes   my   plague , sometimes   my   darling ;   Kissing   to   day ,   to   morrow   snarling ,   then the   surprising   and   sudden   Transformation   of   the   obsequiousness and   obedience   of   the   Lover   to   the   gracefull   haughtyness   & imperiousness   of   the   commanding   husband   must   be   so   agreable   a metamorphosis   as   is   not   be   equall'd   in   all   Ovids   Collection , where   I   don't   remember   a   Lambs   being   transformed   into   a   Bear , then   the   pleasing   variety   of   matrimonial   conversation ,   from the   caconick   sulleness   to   the   long   winded   remonstrances ,   the easy   freedom   of   behaviour ,   &   becoming   negligence   of   dress ,   are the   happiness's   which   attend   no   State   of   life   in   that   force   & beauty   as   the   Matrimonial   one ;   your   Grace   is   much   to   be pittied   who   has   never   known   the   varieties   I   mention ,   &   has found   none   of   this   advantagious   totange   between   the Husband   &   the   Lover ,   but   has   found   all   the   sincerity   of friendship ,   and   complacency   of   a   Lover   in   the   same   Person ;   and I   am   sure   my   Lord   Duke   is   a   most   miserable   Man   who   has   found one   Person   who   has   taken   away   that   passion   for   change   which   is the   boast   &   happiness   of   so   many   people .   Pray   tell   my   Lord Dupplin   when   you   see   him   that   I   give   my   service   to   him ,   but that   I   never   heard   of   a   Viscount   that   was   a   prophet   in   my life :   I   must   say   if   his   Lordship   says   no   more   than   he   knows , he   must   be   a   Man   of   the   most   extensive   knowledge   of   any   in England ;   I   assure   you   I   am   not   going   to   tye   the   fast   knot   you mention ,   whenever   I   have   any   thoughts   of   that   sort   you   may   be sure   I   shall   acquaint   your   Grace   with   it ,   provided   my   joy   is not   in   expressible ,   and   I   will   send   you   a   description   of   The Gentleman   with   his   good   qualities   &   faults   in   full   length ,   And you   who   know   what   a   good   husband   is ,   may   give   me   your   opinion , at   present   I   will   tell   you   what   sort   of   a   Man   I   desire   which is   above   ten   times   as   good   as   I   deserve ,   for   Gratitude   is   a great   virtue ,   &   I   would   therefore   have   cause   to   be   thankfull , I   would   have   him   have   a   great   deal   of   sense   &   prudence   to direct   &   instruct   me ,   much   wit   to   divert   me ,   beauty   to   please me ,   good   humour   to   indulge   in   the   right ,   and   reprove   me   gently when   I   am   in   the   wrong ;   money   enough   to   afford   me   me more   than   I   can   want ,   and   as   much   as   I   can   wish ,   &   constancy to   like   me   as   long   as   other   people   do ,   that   is   till   my   face   is wrinkled   by   age ,   or   scar'd   with   the   small   Pox ,   &   after   that , as   I   shall   not   be   the   Woman   he   took   me   for ,   I   expect   only civility   in   the   room   of   love ,   for   as   Mrs   Clive   sings ,   all   I hope   of   mortal   Man ,   is   to   love   me   whilst   he   can .   When   I   can meet   with   all   these   things   in   a   Man   above   the   trivial consideration   of   Money ,   &   thinks   of   nothing   but   the   gentle generous   passion ,   source   of   all   sublime   delights ,   you   may expect   to   hear   I   am   going   to   change   the   easy   prospect   of happiness ,   for   I   am   already   like   Pygmalion   in   love   with   a picture   of   my   own   drawing ,   but   I   never   saw   an   original   like   it in   my   life ,   I   hope   when   I   do ,   I   shall   as   some   poet   ( I   forget who )   says   of   Pygmalion ,   find   the   Statue   warm .   Pray   if   you   know of   any   such   do   me   the   Favour   to   tell   this   miracle   you   know   of a   Person   who   will   accept   him   with   a   gratefull   heart ,   &   a Chearfull   countenance .   I   believe   Sr   Francis   Dashwood   is   gone abroad ,   he   was   with   Lord   Westmorland   at   Maidstone   Races ,   he was   so   drunk   he   could   not   go   to   the   Assembly ,   I   wish   he   had been   at   our   Races   for   I   have   long   held   a   curious   desire   to   see him ,   I   am   not   near   Lady   Austin ,   nor   have   heard   any   account   of their   Wedding ,   if   either   of   them   are   motionless   I   fancy   it   is Sir   Robert ,   who   is   really   very   unfit   for   motion   by   reason   of his   great   carcass . I   have   heard   something   of   Mrs   Clark   since   I   had   the   account from   your   Grace   she   has   been   very   ill   and   kept   her   room   &   has not   yet   recover'd   her   spirits   enough   to   talk :   there   is   a Gentleman   here   who   was   to   wait   upon   them ,   he   said   every   thing was   very   hansome   upon   the   Wedding ,   they   had   french   Horns playing   all   dinner   time ,   &   every   body   very   gay ,   but   the   silent Bride ,   who   mourn'd   in   secret   or   rejoyced   in   silence   no   one knew   which .   I   think   it   is   pitty   Madame   should   return ,   for   now people   will   begin   to   be   tired   of   talking   of   her   &   let   the Lovers   enjoy   a   little   quiet ,   I   must   say   I   think   the   Nation   has made   a   great   deal   of   noise   about   a   very   little   matter ,   I believe   it   has   been   the   prerogative   of   M-chs   and   the   liberty of   Subjects   to   keep   Mistress's   since   the   institution   of Monarchy ,   &   as   it   is   a   thing   allow'd   of   in   all   civil Governments   it   is   very   hard   to   deny   that   to   a   K-g ,   which   the meanest   of   his   Subject   enjoy   in   peace   and   plenty ,   I   had   a   good diverting   thing   sent   me   upon   the   subject   last   post   which   may divert   you   &   I   think   as   it   only   a   jest   it   cannot   offend ,   I have   likewise   sent   you   some   verses   wrote   by   Lady   Mary   Wortly under   Colonel   Churchills   Picture   at   Vanloes ,   I   heard   he   swore they   were   true   as   soon   as   he   saw   them ;   I   suppose   you   have   seen them   but   I   will   send   you   them   at   a   venture ,   I   had   a   very pretty   Rebus   sent   me   from   London   abt   a   Month   ago ,   it   begins Beauteous   as   the   Rising   Sun ,   & c   I   would   write   it   with   the others   but   that   I   know   you   may   see   all   &   they   say   a   great   deal more   in   the   looking   glass   any   day   you   please .   Lord   Romney   was not   at   our   Races ,   nor   Lord   Rockingham     Mr   Noel ,   Mr Watson ,   Lord   Sherrar   Manners   came   upon   the Down   day ;   &   in   manifest   contempt   of     Assembly &   Ladies   went   that   night     Leeds   Court .   I   have   some suspicion   Lady   Rockingham   is   with   child ,   for   they   did   design coming   to   the   Races   &   then   they   alter'd   their   resolution   &   are now   gone   to   London ;   they   made   but   a   short   stay   at   Paris .   Lady Winchelsea   is   going   to   Bath ,   I   suppose   in   order   to   have   an heir ,   a   Gentleman   asked   him   last   winter   if   her   Ladyship   was breeding ,   &   his   answer   was ,   no   no   we   are   grave   people ,   we   are grave   people ,   but   I   believe   his   gravity   wou'd   in   sober   sadness be   very   glad   of   an   heir   Lady   Winchelsea   has   been   drinking asses   milk   &   Arringo   roots   ever   since   she   was   married ,   I   think if   she   was   to   give   half   her   morning   draughts   to   my   Lord   it might   turn   better   to   account .   The   loquacious   Miss   Lucy ,   &   the Facetious   Miss   Patty   Masters ,   were   at   Canterbury   Races .   I think   they   have   faces   fitted   for   them ,   for   Lucys   countenance is   a   peice   of   illnature   &   censoriousness   &   Pattys   phizies   a very   good   jest ,   she   was   drest   in   a   Jack   &   look'd   to   me   just like   a   Monkey   in   a   cloak   riding   thro'   a   Town   with   every   body staring   &   pug   affecting   a   most   ridiculous   significancy ;   the eyes   of   the   place   were   turn'd   upon   her ,   &   she   imagin'd   it   was to   admire   her   easy   je   ne   scay   quoi   air ,   &   immediately threw   herself   into   such   grimaces   &   postures   as   made   her   very frightfully   diverting .   My   paper   is   so   near   an   end   that   I   have not   room   for   an   apology   for   the   badness   of   my   writing   but   I was   resolved   with   a    pen   I   could   get   to   tell   you   how   much   I   am   your   Graces   Hble Servant   E Robinson 
BC_1739_EMONTAGU_MB	Dec     Friday   Bath Madam After   four   days   journey   in   very   bad   roads I   arrived   here   a   good   deal   tired ,   if   Scaron   had   not   been   very facetious   my   countenance   had   not   received   the   impression of   a   Smile   since   I   left   Whitehall   till   my   Arrival   at Bath ,   I   read   most   part   of   the   way ,   but   was   sometimes taken   off   Le   petit   Ragotins   disasters   to   fear   those   that might   happen   to   la   petite   Fidget ,   a   violent   jolt   or an   undue   biass   of   the   Coach   gave   frequent   &   untimely periods   to   a   Sentence   at   last   I   got   to   the   end   of   a tiresome   journey   to   a   place   no   less   tiresome ,   if   happiness as   is   said   is   comparison ,   how   miserable   must   I   be   after having   left   your   Grace ,   &   those   agreable   friends   by which   you   are   always   surrounded ,   to   come   here   to   the   Assembly Of   Invalids ,   the   morning   after   I   came   to   Bath   I   went   to   the Ladies   Coffee   House ,   where   I   hear'd   of   nothing   but   the Rheumatism   in   the   Shoulder ,   the   Sciatica   in the   hip ,   &   the   Gout   in   the   toe ,   after   these   complaints which   ran   round   the   Room   I   began   to   fancy   my   self in   the   Hospital   or   infirmary ,   I   never   saw   such   an Assembly   of   disorders ,   I   dare   say   Gay   wrote   his   fable of   the   Court   of   death   from   this   place ,   after   drinking the   waters   I   go   to   Breakfast ,   &   about   twelve   I   drink another   glass   of   waters ,   &   then   dress   for   dinner ,   visits   employ the   afternoon ,   &   we   Saunter   away   the   Evening   in great   Stupidity ,   I   think   no   place   can   be   less   agreable , how   d'you   do   is   all   one   hears   in   the   morning ,   &   what is   trumps   in   the   afternoon ;   I   hope   I   shall   live   three months   longer   for   coming   here ,   or   I   shall   be   a   loser by   the   bargain ,   for   I   think   the   time   I   have   dedicated to   Bath   will   be   lost   as   to   pleasure ,   but   I   hope   it will   be   improved   as   to   Health ,   I   shall   bring   a   towardly   disposition of   mind   &   body   for   the   diversions   of   London after   nursing   my   self   here ,   what   most   grieves   me   is that   the   only   pleasure   your   Graces   absence   affords , which   is   writing   to   you ,   is   difficult   here ,   from   the constant   employment   of   drinking   the   waters ,   I   am   ashamed I   have   not   wrote   to   your   Grace   before ,   but   we   have   had a   great   deal   of   company   every   afternoon ,   &   some   in   the most   vacant   part   of   the   morning   from   the   waters ,   so   that I   have   not   had   a   pen   in   my   hand   till   just   now .   Lady   Berkshire did   us   the   honour   of   a   visit   on   wednesday ,   but   we were   just   gone   to   the   Rooms ,   where   she   no   sooner   saw   me than   she   came   to   me   to   enquire   after   your   health ; Lord   Berkshire   is   litterally   speaking   laid   by   the   leg ,   which the   Gout   has   usurp'd ,   for   it   has   ever   been   a   distemper   of very   great   quality ,   &   runs   in   the   best   blood ,   &   consequently in   the   blood   of   the   H-ds ;   Mrs   Howard   and   Mr   Tom   Howard Ld   Berkshire's   youngest   son   are   here ,   as   are   likewise   Mrs Grevile   &   her   Daughter ,   who   ( having   seen   me   with   your   Grace ) enquired   with   great   concern   after   you ,   I   think   if   one   could put   the   whole   World   in   anxiety   as   you   have   done   for   being sick   one   might   be   content   to   be   ill ,   but   for   us   of   small   consequence who   unlamented   dye ,   &   not   a   stone   tells   where   we   lie , it   is   proper   to   come   to   Bath   to   renew   a   bad   constitution , there   is   a   good   many   people   here ,   but   not   many   of   such as   are   known   to   your   Grace ,   those   who   are   most   likely to   be   so   are   as   follow   Lady   Hereford   Lady   Susan     Panter I   think   it   is   Lady   Susan   ( but   I   don't   know   so   well   as   her Godmother )   Lady   Fanny   Shirley ,   Lady   Ann   Furnese   Lady   Anne   Finch ,   Lady Widdrington ,   Miss   Windsors ,   Miss   Gage ,   &   I   should   first have   said   the   Dowager   Dutchess   of   Norfolk ,   &   Mrs   Howard Brigadier   General   Howards   Wife ,   a   Lady   who   accompanys her   pedigree   with   a   narrative   as   well   as   Lord   Percival , for   the   other   day   in   the   coffee   House   I   hear'd   her   delivering her   Genealogy   to   a   Gentleman   with   great   particularity , as   I   remember   she   proved   Noahs   third   Son   was   call'd   Howard   , she   said   she   believed   Tubal   Cain   ( a   man   of   great   ingenuity If   your   Grace   remembers   him   in   the   Book   once   in   fashion ) was   the   first   inventor   of   Surnames ,   &   that   he   called   himself Tubal   Cain   Ho-d ,   but   as   that   was   but   conjecture   she woud   not   insist   upon   it ,   however   she   was   sure   Babel   was to   have   been   call'd   Howard   Castle   if   in   the   general confusion   it   had   not   been   changed   for   syllables   of   inferior fashion ,   as   for   the   men   except   Lord   Noel   Somerset   they   are altogether   abominable ,   there   is   not   one   good ,   no   not   one , so   I   will   say   nothing   of   them ,   as   I   can   say   nothing   for them ,   however   such   as   they   are   I   must   dress   for   them ,   but I   will   leave   my   letter   that   I   may   write   a   supplement   to it   to   morrow ,   if   I   had   not   made   sure   of   a   Partner   before to   day   I   could   not   have   wrote   so   much ,   for   one   is   forced to   look   ones   handsomest   'till   one   has   got   a   Partner ,   least one   should   be   left   forsaken   &   forlorn .   P S   Madam   you   know the   Spectator   says   a   Woman   never   speaks   her   mind   but   in   the Postscript ,   if   so   this   letter   will   be   very   sincere ,   for   I   am   now setting   forward   to   send   you   a   sheet   of   Postscript   if   I   can   find Any   thing   to   fill   it .   Last   night   produced   nothing   but   some bad   dancing   except   Mr   Southell ,   who   was   overwhelm'd   with congratulatory   compliments ,   in   one   day   he   was   chose   Member , made   father   to   a   little   Daughter ,   and   got   a   L   prize   in the   lottery ,   he   seem'd   in   great   spirits ,   &   bow'd   popularly low   to   all   his   acquaintance ,   Amongst   the   rest   I   had   a salutation   from   him   with   as   great   civility   as   if   I   had been   Mayoress   of   Bristol ,   or   had   sent   a   patriot   voice   in screaming   against   the   Excise   or   convention ,   I   was   much pleased   at   the   sight   of   a   Person   who   was   so   happy ,   the delight   of   his   countenance   &   joy   of   his   heart   communicated it   self   to   me ,   &   put   me   in   good   humour   for   the whole   night .   I   hear   Lady   Bab   &   Mr   Mansal   are   come down ,   but   they   have   not   been   in   the   Rooms   yet ,   I   believe there   is   a   great   circulation   of   company   for   the   Bells are   always   ringing   for   some   Body   come ,   or   tolling   for somebody   gone ,   I   think   there   are   several   decreased in   the   Burials   of   this   week ;   here   are   many   people   who I   have   known   &   seen   before ,   but   very   few   who   I   care   whether I   ever   see   them   again ,   one   Person   who   I   like   extreamly ,   loves her   husband   so   much   better   than   she   does   me   that I   can't   persuade   her   to   come   out ;   I   believe   your   Grace   has often   hear'd   me   speak   of   Mrs   Freind ,   who   is   not   at all   like   her   Brother   Sr   Tommy ,   tho'   she   happens   to   be so   nearly   related   to   him ,   what   makes   me   like   her   still   better is   her   great   contempt   for   Mattadors ,   I   don't   believe   she ever   dreamt   of   Spadille   in   her   life ,   tho'   most   people this   place     prefer   its   company   to   that   of   their   best friends .   I   beg   your   Grace   to   my   compliments   to my   Lord   Duke ,   &   Lady   Wallingford ,   to   whome   I   will   write very   soon ,   I   hope   her   Ladyship   is   well ,   I   desire   likewise   my humble   Service   to   Mr   Achard .   I   must   go   &   drink   a glass   of   water   in   which   I   will   drink   your   health ,   & perhaps   it   may   do   you   as   much   good   as   it   will   me ,   for I   don't   yet   know   what   service   they   will   be   of   to   me ,   but   they agree   with   me   very   well ,   &   civilly   permit   me   to   dance . Please   to   direct   to   direct   to   me   at   Mr   Andertons   in   the   Grove   it Will   be   very   charitable   to   write   me   a   line ,   but   I   know you   have   better   diversions   than   writing ,   I   have   no   pleasure any   where   so   great   as   that   of   assuring   your   Grace   that I   am   Madam Your   most   Obedient   &   most   Oblig Humble   Servant Eliza- Saturday   Dec   ye   
BC_1740_EMONTAGU_AD_1	Bullstrode   Aug   ye     Dear   Madam I   never   knew   till   now   that   more   of   my   actions were   guided   by   duty   than   inclination ,   but   when   I   consider   how many   letters   I   have   wrote   to   others   without   one   to   you   to   whom I   had   most   inclination   to   write ,   I   see   plainly   how   far   the   ballance weighs   down   on   the   side   of   obligation   against   that   of   choice ; indeed   I   have   been   much   taken   up   with   writing   two   or   three letters   home   every   post ,   some   of   the   family   expect   them   &   some desire   them ,   &   the   tributes   of   duty   &   love   must   not   be   deny'd . I We   stay'd   much   longer   in   Town   than   we   had   proposed   when you   left   us ,   at   last   we   took   leave   of   an   almost   desolate   Citty to   come   to   the   most   charming   Country ;   you   may   easily imagine   I   am   happy   in   the   best   company   in   the   finest place ,   the   House   is   magnificent ,   &   the   Gardens   &   Park   are beautifull ,   the   owners   of   these   good   things   enjoy   the   commodiousness without   the   Cares   of   Greatness ,   those   disturbers   of   peace vanity   &   ambition   never   enter   their   breasts   who   are   neither   proud for of   what   they   possess   nor   covetous   of   what   others   enjoy ,   our tranquility   was   at   first   disturbed   by   the   little   ones   being   ill But   thank   God   they   are   all   well   again   &   to   repay   the   anxiety I   felt   I   saw   the   best   wife   the   Sincerest   friend   &   the   most   dutiful Daughter   was   the   tenderest   Mother ,   she   felt   too   much   for   them for   her   quiet ,   indeed   it   was   very   happy   it   did   not   last long   for   the   poor   Dutchess   was   quite   cast   down   I   did   not possess   my   Soul   in   quietness   you   may   suppose ,   since   this we   have   been   very   happy   we   read ,   work ,   write   &   walk &   talk   which   you   will   not   doubt   as   I   am   of   the   party , the   hard   frost   has   in   some   measure   spoil'd   our   Consort ,   it is   with   great   pleasure   I   listen   to   your   Sister   Songster   Philomel I   think   with   a   very   little   alteration   Miltons   address   to her   might   be   apply'd   to   you   Sweet   bird   that   shunn'st the   noise   of   folly ,   most   Musical ,   most   melancholly ,   I   hope you   are   not   pester'd   with   impertinence   at   Spa ,   a   redundancy of   Spirits   is   commonly   the   effect   of   health   but   really   at Bath   which   is   the   Land   of   Invalids   I   did   not   find   there   was any   failure   of   impertinence   perhaps   the   Enlivening   Spa may   quicken   Genius's   into   wit   the   Bath   waters   had   not   that effect ,   they   were   not   like   the   Inspiring   Helicon .   The   Goddess dulness   Poet   Laureate   A-n   has   been   in   terrible   apprehension Least   the   oaken   cudgel   should   be   about   that   head   which Laurel   ought   to   crown   &   to   show   that   tho   he   was   shameless he   was   not   fearless   too   &   that   if   he   could couldn't   be   mended   he could   however   be   chastized   he   wrote   letters   of   the   greatest submission   asking   pardon   of   the   Gentleman   he   had abused   &   begg'd   he   would   interceed   with   the   other   Person concern'd   that   he   might   have   leave   to   ask   their   pardon but   they   bid   the   Gentleman   tell   him   he   was   as   safe   in their   contempt   as   he   could   be   in   their   forgiveness   & that   they   desired   not   to   be   troubled   with   him ,   but   the Valourous   Knight   not   thinking   he   had   done   enough made   him   write   a   very   humble   letter   which   by Mrs   P-   was   deliver'd .   I   think   the   Captain   was in   the   right   for   he   was   really   abused   but   for   what he   said   of   any   else   it   was   a   triffle ,   being   a   Star   which hid   its   diminish'd   head   at   the   appearance   of   that   Sun   of   Beauty Molly   Cornwall   I   dare   say   the   Person   never   thought they   should shone   brighter   in   the   Hemisphere   of   Beauty than   a   Star ,   nor   much   cared   what   place   they   maintaind In   Mr   A ns   Zodiack   the   Captain   would   fain   have   made him   fight   but   the   Gentleman   declined   it ,   not   thinking   his Carkass   worthy   a   place   in   the   Bed   of   Honour ,   I   suppose his   Adversary   challenged   him   as   Caius   Marius   adresses   the Apothecary   art   thou   so   poor   &   full   of   wretchedness   & c &   yet   afraid   to   dye ?   but   the   good   proverb   taught   him 'twas   better   to   live   like   a   Dog   than   dye   like   a   Lion . I   wonder   the   Captain   should   be   so   formidably   valourous for   as   Prior   says   Tis   Strange   one   breast   should   be   the   Seat Of   Gentle   Love   &   fell   Debate besides   Cupids   Arrow   is   not   half   so   deadly   as   the Lance   of   Mars ,   no   wound   is   mortal   that   does   not   bleed I   mean   really ,   for   Metaphorically   Lovers   are   wounded they   bleed   Languish   &   dye   but   all   that   dye   see is   but   by   way   of   Simile for   Death   is   no   more   the   end   of   Love   than   Diachylon plaster   is   the   cure   of   it ,   some   dye   in   Metaphor   &   some in   Song   tis   true   but   still   tis   a   Living   Death   &   never   any of   them   come   to   buried   I   will   defy   the   handsomest   Women in   England   to   furnish   out   a   decent   Execution   of   three or   four   Lovers   in   their   whole   lives . The   Dutchess   who   is   writing   to   you   will   give   you   a   better account   of   the   news   of   the   times   than   I   can   do ,   all   that I   have   to   tell   you   is   that   the   Bishops   are   to   meet   to   scratch out   of   the   Matrimonial   Service   that   vulgar   reading   to   have   & to   hold   till   Death   do   us   part   which   to   a   polite   &   free   thinking age   is   an   insupportable   condition   of   an   inconvenient Covenant   &   upon   all   these   separations   I   will   say   in spight   of   Doctor   Shaw   that   those   who   have   Wives   are as   those   that   have   none ,   I   am   sorry   the   female   virtue constancy   is   worn   out   for   if   they   do   not   change   their love   from   one   to   another   they   however   change   it   into Hate ,   I   was   told   by   a   friend   of   a   great   Lady   who   was   parted   from her   Lord   in   the   beginning   of   the   Summer   by   way   of   making her   apology   that   really   the   reason   was   she   hated   her   Husband I   was   shock'd   to   hear   that   alledged   as   an   excuse   that once   would   have   been   mention'd   as   a   Crime   &   could   not help   answering   perhaps   with   more   sincerity   than   prudence that   if   she   did   so   she   did   a   very   wicked   thing   content with   so   summing   up   the   matter   without   mentioning   the   ties Of   Duty   &   Gratitude   to   an   indulgent   Husband   her   friends   think it   a   great   matter   if   they   clear   her   from   the   imputation   of loving   unlawfully   tho'   they   own   she   hates   undutifully to   me   whether   people   don't   do   what   they   ought   to   do   or   do what   they   ought   not   to   do   is   much   the   same   thing for   'tis   only   inclination   makes   the   difference ,   virtue   being then   out   of   the   question .   Sr   john   St   Aubin   has   lost   his   wife &   the   papers   say   is   going   to   Spa ,   I   hear   he   is   inconsolable , I   am   very   sorry   for   him ,   so   fond   a   Husband   must   make   a disconsolate   widower ,   it   is   terrible   to   think   how   Death   will part   the   fondest   friends ,   but   such   is   the   sad   state   of   Wedlock that   either   the   possession   or   loss   may   make   people   miserable but   in   the   precarious   situation   of   this   World   many   are   unhappy &   all   may   be   so .   I   hope   you   find   benefit   by   Spa   you have   my   heartiest   &   Sincerest   wishes   for   every   thing   that concerns   your   welfare   It   would   have   given   me   a   satisfaction I   did   not   deserve   to   have   had   an   account   of   your health   from   yourself   I   hope   now   you   will   favour   me with   it .   I   am   very   sorry   for   the   melancholly   accident   of Mr   Cottingtons   death ,   I   am   sure   your   tenderness   suffers Much   to   see   his   Widow   in   affliction ,   melancholly   is   no   friend to   your   Constitution   that   I   fear   your   body   as   well   as   mind has   suffer'd ,   I   want   much   to   hear   your   account   of   the Place   you   are   in ,   by   what   I   have   hear'd   Nature   appears there   rather   in   dignity   than   Beauty ,   but   great   objects give   prodigious   delight   to   the   imagination ,   which   is thereby   enlarged   &   takes   in   a   greater   train   of   Ideas ,   that   our imagination   by   noble   contemplations   seems   to   stretch it   self   to   a   Higher   degree   of   thought   than   we   usually   possess , we   think   we   see   Omnipotence   plainer   in   the   Prodigious Works   of   Providence   than   in   its   common   works ,   for   tho   we know   by   whom   every   thing   was   created   yet   we   most Admire   the   Creator   in   his   marvellous   Works .   Pip   &   her   Lover have   got   Sympathetick   pains   in   their   head ,   I   thought   the pains   in   the   heart   were   communicative   but   I   did   not   know those   in   the   head   were   so ,   if   that   be   the   case   my   Lovers   when good   fortune   sends   me   any   will   complain   more   of   the head   ach   than   the   heart   ach ,   Pip   &   her   Deare   soon lay   their   heads   together ,   sometime   in   this   month :   they   are   to   be married   by   the   Bishop   of   Gloucester   to   have   the   blessing   at   first   hand . I   desire   the   favour   of   you   to   make   my   compliments   to   Miss   Grevile , I   have   not   the   pleasure   of   being   acquainted   with   Mrs   Price   by   what I   have   hear'd   of   her   her   company   must   make   Spa   much   more Agreable   than   it   would   otherwise   be .   If   Spa   does   not   cure   you   pray try   the   Cold   Bath   I   have   found   infinite   service   from   it ,   I   am   so well   that   I   am   quite   surprized   to   find   I   have   such   an   excellent constitution .   The   direction   to   this   Place   is   Bullstrode   by   Gerrards   cross bag   Bucks .   My   paper   but   not   my   inclination   puts   an   End   to my   letter ,   excuse   the   lengteth   of   it ,   it   is   impossible   to   write   little to   those   one   loves   much ,   so   if   you   will   be   loved   you   must   be troubled   with   your   sincere   &   affectionate   but   Impertinent   friend Eliza   Robinson If   you   could   bring   me   over   grey   Lace   enough   for   the   facing   &   robeing a   Gown   without   any   inconveniences   I   should   be   extreamly   glad   of   it   as   likewise one   of   the   Spa   necklaces   but   I   woud   not   give   you   any   trouble   about   them 
BC_1740_EMONTAGU_AD_2	Bullstrode   Aug   ye   Dear   Mrs   Donnellan There   wanted   no   addition   to   your   letter   to make   me   intirely   happy   but   an   account   of   your   own   health , if   I   was   to   tell   you   the   part   I   take   in   it   you   would   perhaps think   I   said   a   great   deal   more   then   the   period   of   our   friendship will   allow   of ,   so   to   avoid   the   imputation   of   flattery &   too   prompt   professions   of   Esteem   I   will   suppress   a   thousand tender   things   I   think   about   you ,   but   surely   where   one   has found   in   a   few   months   in   one   as   many   valuable   & agreable   qualities   as   one   might   many   years   have   sought   for in   others   it   may   be   permitted   to   one   to   have   soon   for what   is   amiable   &   valuable   such   a   share   of   love   &   esteem as   may   be   deservedly   accounted   friendship .   If   by   the pleasure   of   travelling   to   Spa   in   your   letter   I   can   guess   what it   would   be   to   go   there   in   your   company   nothing   I   think could   make   me   more   happy ,   I   like   the   manner   of   living As   is   quite   new   &   the   Place   so   Romantick .   I   cannot   say   I   am fond   of   such   early   rising ,   or   that   I   delight   in   Cards ,   but custom   would   in   a   weeks   time   make   the   first   easy ,   &   I suppose   for   the   other   it   is   not   worse   than   Bath ,   I   have   heard my   Brother   say   there   are   charming   Cascades   &   Woods , there   we   might   converse   with   the   Naides Naiads   &   Dryads   free from   noise   impertinence   &   folly ,   &   leave   the   dull   farce the   empty   show ,   of   Powder   Pocket   glass   &   Beau   for Silence   &   Meditation ,   I   wish   the   Waters   agreed   with my   Brother   &   I   could   easily   prevail   upon   him   to   go &   gallant   us ,   I   must   tell   you   I   have   the   happiness   of hearing   he   is   much   better   in   health   than   he   has   been of   late   years ,   as   I   have   heard   you   say   you   know   the   happiness of   having   a   good   Brother   I   am   sure   you   will   easily   guess   the   pleasure this   gives   me .   Your   praises   of   my   friend   &   friendship   pleased me ,   extreamly ,   I   admire   my   friend   above   all   people ,   &   friendship above   all   things ,   it   has   all   the   tenderness   of   love   without   its weakness's ,   &   its   extasies   without   its   jealousies ,   it   is   founded   in Reason   &   strengthen'd   by   time ,   a   friend   is   the   better   for   wearing And   I   think   the   greatest   happiness   this   World   can   bestow is   to   have   a   friend   &   be   a   friend ,   I   believe   no   one   knows better   all   the   charms   of   friendship   than   you ,   else   I   should not   venture   to   say   so   much   in   praise   of   it ,   having   often heard   it   laugh'd   at   as   a   thing   rather   in   name   than in   nature ,   I   own   I   generally   shunn'd   the   company   where I   knew   the   Social   tyes   were   made   a   jest   of ,   but   many make   self   interest   the   only   cement   of   Society .   I   am sorry   to   think   so   meanly   of   my   Species ,   I   believe   such   things are   cheifly   said   by   those   who   have   not   the   tender   feelings of   humanity ,   &   therefore   would   as   soon   take   a   blind   mans word   that   there   is   no   such   thing   as   the   light   that   he   does not   see ,   as   the   opinion   of   these   Savages   of   Society   when   they   say   there   is   no Virtue   which   they   do   not   feel .   I   hope   you   received   a   letter from   the   Dutchess   with   a   prodigious   long   Epistle   from   me sometime   ago .   Our   friend   Penny   is   under   great   anxiety   for the   change   her   Sister   is   going   to   make   I   do   not   wonder   at   her fears ,   I   believe   both   experience   &   observation   have   taught   her The   State   she   is   going   into   is   in   the   general   less   happy than   that   she   has   left ,   however   Pip   has   a   good   prospect for   they   say   the   Gentleman   has   good   sense   good   nature   & great   Sobriety ,   these   are   very   good   things ,   &   indeed   what   a stock   of   virtues   &   qualifications   ought   to   be   laid   in   to last   out   the   journey   of   life ,   where   so   much   too   lies   thro the   Rugged   ways   of   adversity ,   all   will   hardly   serve to   lengthen   love   &   patience   to   the   End . The   last   sparks   of   life   &   vanity   are   at   length   extinguishd in   Lady   Kaye ,   I   believe   she   has   left   all   her   Riches   to Lady   North ,   but   whom   she   has   bequath'd   her complexion   I   dont   know ,   she   had   likewise   some   pretty features   enough   to   dispose   of ,   as   eye   brows   lips   &   teeth , I   suppose   she   has   order'd   to   be   buried   in   the   last   wish of   an   Antiquated   beauty   cherry   colour ,   the   fatal   Sisters spun   the   line   of   her   life   so   equal   with   the   thread   of   her vanity   that   they   were   shorn   in   the   same   instant , had   she   confin'd   her   vivacity   to   mere   follies   her   life had   been   a   very   good   jest ;   It   is   very   happy   for   her   Daughter that   she   will   fall   under   other   management .   I   am   dear   Madam & c .   & c E.   Robinson . 
BC_1740_EMONTAGU_AD_3	Sunday My   Dear   Friend In   the   zeal   of   my   heart ,   &   delicacy   ( for   it   is   not   jealousy ) of   my   friendship ,   I   was   going   very   often   to   write   to   you   on   purpose to   chide   you   for   not   giving   me   the   comfort   of   hearing   from   you while   I   was   under   an   uneasy   situation   of   mind :   I   thought   to myself   that   had   I   known   you   to   be   under   the   like   circumstance I   should   not   have   forborn   it ;   but   again   I   corrected   myself   when   refflected when   I   refflected I   should   not   in   justice   complain   if   your   silence   proceeded   from even   a   want   of   love   while   if   I   enjoy'd   any   Share   of   it   I   had a   great   happiness   which   I   did   not   nor   could   not   merit :   at   last your   kind   letter   arrived   to   cure   me   of   all   complaints ,   but   tho   it eased   my   weakness   I   would   not   dissemble   it   to   you ,   for   I   ought I   think   to   let   you   know   every   infirmity   of   my   heart   & every   caprice   of   my   mind ,   that   you   may   know   my   faults and   wear   me   so   soild   or   throw   me   off   if   you   cannot   bear my   blemishes :   I   will   answer   that   you   will   find   me   sincere affectionate   &   constant   in   my   friendship ,   but   know   I   have a   very   chagrin   impatience   of   being   forgotten ,   am   most   mournfull &   melancholly   when   neglected ,   &   if   quite   deserted   by   a Friend   should   be   apt   to   be   extreamly   miserable :   as   Lady Betty   Modish   says   of   her   Lover   I   wear   like   Indian   Damask , but   you   must   not   think   to   give   me   away   to   your   maid nor   dye   me ,   for   I   am   true   blue   &   change   not .   Your   care of   my   health   in   not   giving   me   an   opportunity   of   writing   to you   was   certainly   kind ,   but   I   will   own   to   you   it   is   a benefit   of   that   high   sort   which   we   hardly   understand , you   behaved   to   me   like   a   being   of   superior   wisedom   that knew   what   was   best   for   me   better   than   I   did   for   my   self for   really   writing   tho   pleasant   has   not   been   beneficial   to   me , but   now   I   am   so   well   I   may   do   any   thing .   I   was   much chagrin'd   at   my   Brothers   disappointment ,   but   when   things   are unalterable   one   must   make   oneself   as   easy   as   one   can ,   &   I   hope it   happen'd   for   the   best ,   indeed   I   have   ever   look'd   upon   all accidents   ( except   the   loss   of   a   friend )   with as   unsearchable ,   it is   impossible   to   determine   certainly   whether   they   are   good or   ill ,   the   final   Event   of   things   is   far   beyond   our   ken ,   &   it   is   a folly   to   trust   too   much   to   our   Conjectures   about   them . You   envy   our   Society   but   it   has   its   cares   too ,   the   Dutchess   is   still not   well ,   I   fear   there   may   be   breeding   in   the   case   but   of   this I   say   nothing ;   she   is   hysterical   &   low :   Pen   is   a   great   comfort To   her ,   indeed   she   is   very   tender   &   amiable ;   her   fondness   for her   Sister   is   delightfull   &   there   is   nothing   of   affectation   in it :   I   was   ever   an   Enemy   to   flattery   &   Hypocrisy   &   I   hate   it more   every   day ;   Truth   &   nature   are   always   charming , where   they   are   but   homely   still   they   are   amiable ,   but borrow'd   characters ,   forged   sentiments ,   pretended   affections   & constrain'd   behaviour ,   are   strangely   disagreable ;   in   a   conversation we   had   together   we   condemn'd   imitating   characters ,   & indeed   with   great   reason   it   never   succeeds ;   I   know   a   Person that   has   made   themselves   very   disagreable   by   a   vain   endeavour to   be   like   another   who   is   really   agreable ;   &   have   twenty   insupportable faults   by   no   other   thing   than   intending   to   be   perfect , what   is   foolish   they   wd   not   determine   against   because   they   have too   much   humility   to   trust   their   own   judgment ,   what   is   wrong they   dare   not   condemn   for   fear   of   not   being   perfectly charitable ,   what   is   amiss   they   wd   not   punish   for   fear   of being   illnatured ,   &   so   on .   but   thus   it   must   ever   happen   to those   who   do   not   build   on   truth ,   but   are   troubled   with the   Vice   of   Speciousness   ( if   you   will   accept   of   a   new   phrase ) this   Speciousness   is   an   incurable   fault ,   for   it   gets   so   many Admirers   among   ye   foolish   that   there   is   no   making   it   detestable in   the   eyes   of   the   possess'd ;   I   find   so   much   false   reasoning &   such   a   narrow   view   of   things   with   these   sort   of   people that   it   puts   me   out   of   patience ,   I   had   rather   ride   upon a   Mill   horse   than   converse   with   scanty   brain'd   people ;   I shall   take   a   lamthern lanthern   &   go   about   looking   for   Truth   as the   philosopher   did   when   he   went   in   quest   of   an   Honest Man ;   but   Alass   Truth   fled   from   the   World   with   justice ,   &   wisely she   did   to   accompany   Astrea   who   alone   ownd owns   her   as   a   benefactor &   treats   her   as   a   friend :   Pray   burn   this   letter   I   beg   as   soon   as you   have   answerd   it ;   know   I   like   not   Imitation ,   Adulation nor   Admiration ,   I   think   them   three   bad   threads   to   weave   a   character upon :   we   agree   in   our   opinions   of   persons ;   I   find   nothing natural   in   their   character ,   nothing   wise   in   their   conversation , nothing   agreable   in   their   manner ,   so   far   we   meet   exactly , I   believe   they   are   good   enough ,   but   such   an   affectation   of transcendent   goodness   I   never   met   with :   then   they   admire with   such   extravagance ,   commend   with   such   flattery   & imitate   with   such   absurdity ,   &   pitty   with   such   weakness   it   is intolerable ;   their   compassion   for   a   Mite   in   a   microscope   is   as great   as   it   would could   be   for   a   fellow   Creature ;   then   they   have   a desire   of   knowledge   like   the   craving   of   hunger ,   but   at   the same   time   a   diffidence   of   themselves   that   is   pretty   to   ye   last   degree I   am   just   reading   Wolleston   &   therefore   perhaps   the fonder   of   truth   as   he   builds   Morality   &   happiness upon   it   ( I   have   got   no   further   in   ye   book )   but   I   think I   was   before   a   Lover   of   Truth   as   that   which alone   could   bring   us   to   Virtue   &   happiness ,   surely there   is   neither   wisdom   nor   virtue   in   Error   & looking   upon   things   to   be   otherwise   that   they   are ; if   Vice   is   not   to   be   hated   folly   not   condemn'd   we must   begin   again ,   I   am   mistaken   in   my   principles &   actions   drawn   from   false   principles   may must   be wrong   &   uncertain :   but   alass   it   is   difficult   to get   at   truth ,   it   is   clouded   by   ignorance ,   perplex'd by   Science ,   perverted   by   interest ,   alter'd   by   prejudice , he   alone   who   is   the   Light   of   all   things ,   who can   bring   light   out   of   Darkness   can   inform   us right ;   oh   may   he   guide   our   opinions   to   truth , our   Actions   to   justice ,   &   fill   our   hearts   with Religion   &   piety :   these   are   the   ways   of   pleasantness And   the   Paths   of   peace ,   joy   is   for   the   Righteous   &   gladness for   the   upright   in   heart ;   as   for   the     pleasure   of   a Mad   World   where   Wickedness   transact   ye   business   &   folly prepares   the   diversions   I   am   now   too   old   to   think   I   can   be happy   by   its   manners   &   in   its   way ,   there   is     much   vice in   it   to   hate ,   so   much   misery   in   it   to   pitty   it   will   not admit   of   that   tranquility   which   a   weariness   of   action   must   make us   wish   for ;   I   do   not   mean   that   I   wd   withdraw   from   the   World for   always   but   I   would   wish   to   withdraw   my   mind   from   its follies   Vices   &   Delusions   &   establish   a   Retreat   in   my   own   breast , where   I   wd   find   Virtues   honest   &   amiable ;   Wisedom   &   Science I   am   Content   to   renounce ,   &   but   affections   good   &   delicate I   wd   wish   to   plant   there .   Cheifly   a   great   gratitude   to   my   friends &   benevolence   towards   all   whom   a   good   heart   intitled   to   good   will . I   think   you   my   friend   are   capable   of   assisting   me   in   this ,   &   I   am not   idle   or   Hypocritical   in   my   request ,   I   ask   for   your   advice   &   direction &   most   when   you   see   it   necessary   for   your   reproof :   I   am   perswaded   our friendship   is   well   fix'd ,   indeed   I   love   you   so   tenderly   it   would   be   a great   affliction   to   me   to   think   otherwise .   I   am   sorry   you   are   not In   perfect   health ;   pray   Divert   your   mind   it   is   the   best   Recipe for   health .   I   desire   my   best   complimts   to   Mrs   Percival ,   I   have sent   for   the   Cowslips   for   her :   my   good   wishes   attend   the   Invalid &   are   hourly   desiring   his   recovery   of   Ease .   Mr   Clark   will   tell you   he   finds   me   much   mended .   I   shall   not   stay   in   Town   with   the Dutchess ,   I   think   the   having   one   in   London   is   an   obligation   one   ought to   be   asham'd   to   reserve ,   for   there   is   no   want   of   company   &   one   must therefore   be   only   a   trouble ,   &   I   am   already   too   deep   in   the   Debt   of obligations   ever   to   hope   to   be   able   to   pay ,   so   I   think   it   is   well I   am   not   tempted   with   this   addition   which   I   shd   not   were   it   put to   my   choice   be   able   to   refuse ,   I   have   not   the   Virtue ,   that   is shamefull   too ,   I   have   so   seldom   an   opportunity   of   being   generous sure   I   ought   not   to   lose   it .   pray   burn   my   letter   I   repeat   it   with earnestness .   Dr   Young   came   on   friday   but   have   had   no   conversation with   him   for   he   has   always   been   writing   except   at   meals .   I   am Yours E R 
BC_1740_EMONTAGU_AD_4	Bulstrode Dear   Mrs   Donnellan I   rather   want   the   privilege   of   an   excuse   than the   force   of   a   command   to   make   me   write   to   you ;   I   hear   you   want wish for   a   letter   for   me ,   I   am   too   desirous   of   the   agreable   consequences   of   the answer   to   defer   putting   in   a   claim   for   it   immediately . I   believe   our   Society   shares   many   of   your   good   wishes   &   much   of   your Rememberance ,   we   are   indeed   a   happy   Set   of   people ,   we   enjoy the   delicacies   of   Life ,   refin'd   friendship ,   agreable   conversation , &   rational   amusements ;   we   have   lost   our   Divines   whose   company we   should   regret ,   if   regret ,   or   any   child   of   chagrin   durst enter   here ;   there   is   great   pleasure   in   conversing   with   people of   such   a   turn   as   Dr   Young   &   Dr   Clarke ,   for   the   first   there is     nothing   of   speculation   either   in   the   Terra   firma   of Reason ,   or   the   visionary   province   of   fancy ,   into   which   he   does not   lead   the   imagination ;   in   his   conversation   he   examines every   thing ,   determines   hardly   any   thing ,   but   leaves   ones judgment   at   Liberty :   the   other   goes   far   into   a   subject   & seldom   leaves   the   conclusion   of   an   argument   unfinish'd ,   he   seems to   me   to   have   an   accurate   judgment   &   a   very   attentive   observation of   every   thing   that   comes   within   his   view ,   &   thus   with   the Assistance   of   a   happy   memory   he   has   laid   up   a   great   stock   of knowledge   and   experience ;   and   he   is   of   a   very   communicative disposition :   The   love   of   talking   ought   ever   to   go   along   with the   Power   of   pleasing   and   instructing ,   &   it   is   thus   properly disposed   with   him ,   but   by   a   weary   observation   on   others ,   & a   mortifying   experience   in   myself ,   I   find   there   is   a   love of   talking   implanted   in   us   distinct   from   the   benevolence benevolent   design of   improving   our   hearers   or   the   vanity   of   hoping   to   be   admired , for   giving   pleasure   or   instruction ,   and   that   we   are   impell'd by   a   kind   of   instinct   to   prate :   this   seems   indeed   impertinent in   particulars ,   but   Nature   ( of   whose   plantation   it   is )   did   not do   it   in   impertinence :   Providence   knew   we   should   be Niggards   of   speech   as   we   are   of   other   benefits   where   the communication   of   them   is   more   for   the   advantage   of   others than   our   own   proper   pleasures ,   &   as   we   were   design'd   for Society ,   and   the   bands   of   Society   are   but   the   interests   of   self   love , it   has   made   the   first   principle   of   conversation   to   dwell   immediately in   the   breast   of   every   one :   Silent   people   love   Retirement and   do   not   seek   one   to   listen   to   as   a   talkative   Person   does   one to   talk   to ,   therefore   speech   which   cheifly   associates   Human kind   operates   immediately ,   not   by   remote   influences   or   distant Causes ,   nor   is   not   dependant   on   Education ,   Custom ,   virtue ,   vice , Country ,   Language   or   Nation ,   but   is   common   to   all ,   as   all people love   to   speak   they   must   seek   some   other   to   speak   to ; I   have   great   pleasure   in   observing   to   myself   how   Providence has   dispers'd   all   things   in   the   Order   of   the   World   to   help to   associate   mankind :   how   it   has   made   the   pleasure   & safety   of   men   to   depend   on   their   association ,   how   their weaknesses   tend   to   their   happiness   by   putting   them   under that   best   teacher   of   Arts   Necessity :   for   this   reason   he   is not   arm'd   with   strength   to   attack   his   foes   like   a   Lion   nor   against   the injuries   of   weather   like   a   Bear ;   the   Woods   are   dangerous &   the   fields   uncomfortable   to   him ,   even   the   inclement Seasons   of   the   year   force   him   into   Society .   Nature   then withdraws   her   Support ,   &   in   winter   becomes   an   Enemy   who in   Summer   was   his   Cateress :   his   covering   is   gone ,   his   Sustenance is   decay'd ,   his   prospect   spoild ,   even   the   more   gentle   inhabitants of   the   Woods   are   vanish'd ,   he   has   nothing   to   lose   but   life , knows   no   want   but   hunger ,   no   use   of   any   thing   but   eating it ,   he   does   not   therefore   fear   any   Creature   to   whom   he   is   not a   dinner ,   so   he   seeks   his   fellow   man ,   they   approach   without distrust ,   ( for   distrust   is   the   offspring   of   Deceit   which   was   born   in after   ages )   our   Savages   understand   each   other   &   are   glad to   express   those   feelings   of   pain   pleasure   & c   which   they are   liable   to ;   different   Relations   and   variety   of   Circumstances Teach   new   expressions ,   and   as   business   and   Commerce   increase language   grows   more   copious ,   till   at   length   mix'd   circumstances , various   arts ,   multiplicity   of   Sciences   and   the   medley   of   affairs have   made   it   what   it   is :   how   are   the   simple   wants   of   Nature divided   &   enlarged !   what   fancy'd   wants ,   what   supplemental   arts , &   what   language   to   express   them ,   are   sprung   from   hunger thirst ,   &   heat   &   cold ;   strong   necessity   of   appetite   &   violent   extreams   of   weather was   all   that   impress'd   a   feeling   in   untaught   nature , but   necessity   supply'd ,   luxury   shaped   the   overplus   into   those things   we   now   pursue ,   and   virtue ,   vice ,   &   praise   &   blame , happiness   and   misery ,   are   all   sprung   from   these   few   Elements of   necessity   thus   charged   by   the   wantonness   of   superfluety , Even   the   Heroes   ambition   unmeasur'd   as   it   is ,   &   all   the fulness   of   the   Orators   Eloquence   draw   their   passions   &   Words   from a   few   wants   &   those   simple   words   that   express'd   them ; and   now   Lawgivers   grow   great   by   restraining ,   poets   &   Orators famous   by   expressing   the   passions   that   were   once   but   for   the mere   support   of   life   &   afforded   but   one   mode   of   expressing   them &   plain   means   of   satisfying   them ,   but   what   complicated   Creatures   are we   now !   what   would   the   first   of   Mankind   who   desired   but as   much   meat   as   he   could   eat ,   &   as   much   ground   as   coud   cover with   his   body   have   thought   of   the   Avarice   of   Cresus ,   or   the Ambition   of   Alexander   if   he   could   have   been   told   that   such Men   would   once   be ?

I   have no   Cambrick   of   yours ,   that   with   the   bad   Selvedge I   have   here ,   but   what   I   spoke   of   was   the   Cambrick I   brought   at   Bath   for   single   ruffles .

BC_1740_EMONTAGU_ER_3	Hon'd   Madam I   am   always   very   glad   to   hear   from   you ,   the diversions   of   my   present   way   of   life   often   prevent my   writing   to   my   Father   &   you   as   I   ought   to   do , but   I   hope   when   I   get   into   the   Country   I   shall be   able   to   imploy   my   time   in   that   respect   more according   to   my   duty   &   inclination ,   I   am   much obliged   to   my   father   for   his   concern   for   my health   I   think   the   cold   Bath   will   prove   the means   of   establishing   it ,   Sandys   who   comes to   visit   me   to   continually   to   see   if   his   Bathing prescription   Prescripti   agrees   with   me   says my   pulse   is   much   alter'd   by   it ,   &   the   Guide at   the   Bath   says   I   am   vastly   stronger   than   I was   at   first   going   in ,   I   am   indeed   as   much better   as   is   possible ,   &   must   devise   some   means Of   sousing   in   the   Country ,   here   I   go   in   every   day &   as   I   told   you   it   is   very   expensive ,   by   the   Month it   is   more   reasonable   but   the   uncertainty   of   our stay   in   Town   besides   the   chance   of   its   disagreeing which   one   is   never   a   judge   of   at   first   &   the   many accidents   of   cold   & c   which   render   it   improper made   it   very   improper   for   me   to   make   a bargain   for   a   term   as   long   again   as   I   could stay   in   Town ,   but   as   it   is   I   must   have   recourse to   my   Brother   Morris   whom   I   have   not   seen   this age ,   for   he   is   so   busy   &   I   am   so   idle   we   seldom meet .   I   sent   a   message   to   Mrs   Knight   &   the   family the   morning   after   they   came   to   Town ,   in   an   hour after   I   had   a   line   from   her   to   tell   me   she   should be   glad   to   see   me   when   I   pleased ,   upon   which the   Dutchess   set   me   down   at   her   door   the   same morning   she   received   me   with   much   civility   but it   was   so   constrain'd   that   I   was   sorry   for   her sake   that   She   had   neither   Sincerity   nor   dissimulaty there   is   a   fine   contrast   between   her   &   the   friend I   am   with ,   you   know   upon   these   occasion   my backbone   straitens   &   stiffens   much ,   all   I   could   do I   could   not   talk ,   so   I   was   forced   to   say   I   wanted Spirits   &   by   good   fortune   I   had   been   up   very late   the   night   before   at   Vauxhall   so   I   did not   look   as   fresh   as   I   have   done   lately ,   with which   I   believe   she   was   much   delighted , for   she   said   she   had   hear'd   so   much   of   my looking   well   that   she   could   not   peceive   so   great an   alteration ,   I   made   her   an   afternoon   visit   on   saturday   for   fear   she   shou'd   say   that   now   I   keep company   with   great   folks   I   did   not   remember   little ones ;   Miss   Brodnax   &   I   walk'd   that   afternoon   in the   Park   &   all   the   Gentlemen   of   my   acquaintance have   laugh'd   at   me   for   picking   out   such   a   foil ; We   go   out   of   Town   on   Sunday ,   I   dined   at   Dover   Street   last Sunday ,   &   put   on   my   new   head ,   it   is   extreamly   hansome , very   broad   &   the   lace   has   more   thin   work   in   it   than has   been   made   till   this   year ,   which   makes   it   more beautifull   than   when   they   were   as   thick   as   Cambrick , My   Duty   to   my   Pappa   &   I   am   madam   your   most   Dutifull Daughter   E R 
BC_1740_EMONTAGU_ER_4	Madam I   might   begin   my   letter   like   the   new   Satire lately   publish'd   are   these   things   so ,   I   can   hardly   think I   am   in   my   senses ,   &   that   Mr   C.   is   the   generous magnificent   disinterested   Person   you   speak   him , yet   I   am   sure   it   is   no   Dream ,   for   that   must proceed   from   some   preceeding   thought   or   Idea in   the   Mind ,   now   I   protest   I   had   not   any   one Notion   in   that   figure ,   but   as   there   may   be Probability   without   truth ,   so   there   may   be   truth witht   probability ,   that   these   things   are   so   like the   answer   to   the   said   Satire   I   know ,   but   why they   are   so   is   the   difficult   thing   to   decide ,   that the   works   of   a   M–r   are   likely   to   be   bad   is   nothing   hard   to make   appear   for   the   Satirist ,   but   how   I   the   Panegyrist shall   deduce   good   principles   from   a   Sa-r   is Another   Story ,   it   is   a   contradiction   to   all   Moral things   that   a   S- r   should   be   honest ,   'tis   a   refutation of   holy   Gospel ,   The   Tree   is   not   to   be   known   by   its fruit ,   the   Evil   tree   hath   brought   forth   good   fruit &   lo   we   have   gatherd   grapes   of   thistles .   But   fear not   that   I   should   publish   satire   against   him ,   I   will comment   &   Compliment   him   an   inch   thick ,   nay I   begin   to   love   him   so   well   that   I   am   almost sorry   that   when   I   speak   well   of   him   no   body   will believe   me ,   but   by   a   gratefull   temper   I   am   pleased to   think   that   as   we   are   the   first   Persons   he   ever obliged   we   shall   be   too   the   first   that   ever   commended him ,   &   Mr   Sawbridge   who   hates   Vulgar   &   received opinions   will   say   with   the   few   ( even   tho   he   should be   so   unhappy   as   to   think   with   the   many )   different that   C   is   in   an   Honest   Generous   Man .   I   think I   never   was   so   happy   as   upon   this   good   news ,   you know   I   always   believed   we   should   all   be   rich one   after   another ,   Hope   is   my   Recreation   you too   often   chuse   dispair   for   your   amusement ,   but sure   now   you   will   not   so   mistrust   fortune ,   she does   civil   things   in   a   merry   mood ,   if   she   will deck   me   in   the   trinkets   I   will   thank   her ,   if   not   she   may keep   her   bawbles   for   vainer   fools   than   my   self . Blessings   &   preservation   are   in   the   hands   of   Providence &   merit   is   its   care ;   on   that   for   weighty   matters I   depend   ,   but   for   the   lucky   works   of   chance I   will   keep   a   mind   more   easy ,   what   nothing   earthly gives   or   can   destroy ,   the   Souls   calm   sunshine   &   the   heart felt   joy ,   is   Virtues   prize ,   so   my   virtue   is   portion'd , what   further   dower   my   Father   gives   it   I   will thank   him   for ,   now   the   golden   days   of   naked   truth &   innocence   are   over   I   must   be   clothed ,   &   fed   too   a little   &   have   a   small   Lodging ,   with   some   triffling Satisfactions   for   Mortality .   but   my   inward   divinity is   soon   satisfied   &   that   I   hope   will   keep   me   chearfull Social   &   Serene ,   &   the   mind   is   the   noble   part ,   tho my   body   seems   cheafly   yours   tis   that   which   tells   me I   must   ever   be     Madam   your   most   Dutifull Gratefull   &   affectionate   Daughter E   Robinson I   beg   my   compliments to   my   Pappa   with   all respect .   I   am   sorry   I   cannot   write   to   my   Sister   to   night I   hear   Jamaica   is   attack'd 
BC_1740_EMONTAGU_ER_5	Madam Much   visiting   has   of   late   hinder'd   my writing   to   you .   My   Lady   Dutchess   does   not   care   to spare   me   to   write   except   when   she   is   so   employ'd   too , &   the   time   set   on   part   for   that   is   the   evening ,   & when   we   make   visits   at   any   distance   it   is   late   before we   return ,   &   letters   go   from   here   between   ten   &   eleven ; when   we   first   came   down   we   supt   at   nine ,   but we   found   so   early   an   hour   encroach'd   too   much   upon our   hours   of   writing ,   so   now   we   sup   at   ten ,   at which   time   the   Duke   comes   into   the   Dutchess's dressing   Room   where   we   write   together ,   &   franks our   Packets ,   which   indeed   are   pretty   large . On   Saturday   we   were   at   Windsor   to   visit   Miss   Granvilles daughters   to   the   famous   Ld   Lansdown ,   they   unhappily inherit   neither   the   wit   of   their   Father   nor beauty   of   their   Mother ,   the   youngest   will   make a   tolerable   pretty   Woman ,   but   for   Miss   Granville She   wears   her   merit   with   as   little   ornament   as ever   I   saw ,   without   one   charm   of   person   or   understanding , she   has   merit   which   does   not   engage ,   &   good sense   which   does   not   please   ( they   say   she   has   sense who   know   her ,   but   it   is   not   quite   apparent   to   Strangers ) she   is   quite   unprovided   for ,   &   is   such   a   one   as many   will   pitty   but   I   fear   none   will   help ,   I mean   in   the   matrimonial   way ,   her   Sister   I   believe will   have   a   tolerable   person   when   she   is   a   Woman , but   seems   to   me   disagreable   enough ,   the   Dutchess is   very   civil   to   them ,   Miss   Granville   was   her acquaintance   from   infancy ,   &   it   is   very   right   in her   to   take   notice   of   her   now .   Lord   Weymouth supports   them ,   but   how   long   he   will   be   willing or   able   to   do   that   no   one   knows ,   he   is   extreamly good   natured   but   his   companions   do   them   no   good offices .   On   Sunday   I   was   at   Mrs   Hares   widow   to the   Late   Bishop   Hare ,   &   was   much   entertain'd   there by   Sr   John   Shadwell   &   his   family   who   are   just   come From   Abroad ,   they   gave   us   an   account   of   several   things which   diverted   us   better   than   one   is   usually   entertain'd at   a   Country   visit .   Lady   Shadwell   saw   Lady   Mary Wortley   at   Venice   where   she   now   resides ,   &   ask'd her   what   made   her   leave   England ,   she   told   them the   reason   was   people   were   grown   so   stupid   she could   not   endure   their   company ,   all   England was   infected   with   dullness ,   by   the   by   what   she means   by   insupportable   dullness   is   her   husband , for   it   seems   she   never   intends   to   come   back while   he   lives ,   a   Husband   may   be   but   a   dull Creature   to   one   of   Lady   Marys   sprightly   genius but   methinks   even   her   vivacity   might   accommodate itself   to   living   in   the   Kingdom   with   him , She   is   a   Woman   of   great   family   merit ,   she   has banish'd   her   Children   &   abandon'd   her   husband , I   suppose   as   she   cannot   reach   Constantinople she   will   limit   her   Ambition   to   an   intrigue with   the   Pope   or   the   Doge   of   Venice . Tho   the   Imperial   signal   of   the   handkercheif   may better   delight   her   Ambition ,   say   nothing   of   what I   have   said   at   Hatch ,   because   there   they   hold   her Virtues   in   great   Veneration ,   judging   her   by   her   words which   are   good ,   without   considering   how   her   practice follow'd   her   precepts ,   I   know   some   others   who   are the   dupes   of   her   dissimulation ,   I   believe   I   forgot to   tell   you   I   had   a   letter   from   Mrs   Clayton   just before   I   left   Town ,   she   was   then   very   well ,   when I   have   answer'd   it   I   will   send   it   to   you .   Miss   Betty Fowler   is   married   to   Mr   Chaddock ,   more   I   fancy to   her   content   than   Mr   Danes ,   who   now   loses   the hopes   of   her   fortune ,   they   are   all   in   Town   I   suppose now   the   Wedding   is   over   they   will   go   down . The   Duke   of   Leeds's   wedding   was   very   grand ,   the Duke   of   Newcastles   Entertainment   upon   the   occasion was   fifteen   dishes   in   a   Course   four   Courses ,   the   Dutchess of   Newcastle   Sister   to   Ldy   Mary   Godolphin   &   Mr   Hay are   gone   down   with   the   Duke   and   Dutchess   of   Leeds .   The Dutchess   had   a   diamond   necklace   from   her   Mother   worth   ten   thousand pound   she   was   very   fine   in   Cloaths   &   jewels ,   the   old   Duchess   of Marlbro'   is   now   mightily   fond   of   her ,   her   Grace   is   at Law   with   the   Duke   of   Marlbro' ,   she   talk'd   two   hours like   the   Widow   Blackacre   in   Westminster   Hall , amongst   things   of   value   which   she   was   to   surrender to   the   Duke   there   was   the   late   Dukes   fine   sword &   George ,   Oh   says   she   as   for   the   George   he   will   sell it ,   but   for   the   Sword   he   won't   know   what   to do   with   that ,   so   I   believe   he   will   lay   it   by ,   or   may be   if   He   can   he   will   pawn   it ,   he   can   make   no other   use   of   it   I   am   sure .   I   am   sorry   my   Brother Robert   has   not   got   any   of   our   letters ,   he   was   very good   to   write   to   us   all ,   he   is   lately   much   reconciled to   pen   &   ink .   Pray   have   you   heard   from   the   dear   little boys ,   I   design   to   write   to   them   soon     I   have   thought   of   them very   often ,   but   I   have   always   forgot   to   enquire   their   direction , I   think   it   is   at   Scorton   near   Richmond ,   but   I   am not   sure ,   so   I   beg   the   Person   who   writes   next   would inform   me .   I   had   a   letter   yesterday   from   Morris   who I   find   proposes   to   be   with   you   very   soon ,   then   you   will be   a   pretty   sound   family .   I   believe   you   are   under great   apprehensions   of   my   having   too   much   spirits , but   I   assure   you   in   that   it   is   not   easy   to   exceed   the   family I   am   in ,   we   enjoy   much   mirth   &   laughter   here   from the   continuance   of   good   humour   &   the   enjoyment   of   all Wordly   happiness   their   chearfulness   is   quite   uninterrupted I   never   saw   them   out   of   temper   in   my   life .   the   Dutchess desires   her   compliments   to   you   &   my   Pappa   pray   give   my duty   to   him   &   love   to   my   Brothers   &   Sister   I   am   Madam Yr   Most   Dutifull   Daughter   E   Robinson 
BC_1740_EMONTAGU_MR_1	Bullstrode   Aug:   ye   Sir I   wish   I   could   say   by   way   of   preface   to   my letter   that   I   received   yours ,   but   your   dislike   of   so   vulgar   an   Expression makes   you   very   carefull   of   giving   your   correspondents   an   opportunity of   making   use   of   it ,   however   while   you   permit   me   to   write I   shall   venture   to   do   it   even   without   that   easy   way   of   address . I   find   our   good   friends   have   at   last   pitch'd   upon   a   Candidate for   the   County   but   am   inform'd   the   strength   of   Claret   at   first   put   them   out of   the   power   of   pronouncing   two   such   difficult   names   as Roger   Twisden ,   had   any   Gentlemans   name   been   bottle   he had   certainly   then   been   named .   I   am   charged   with   many   compliments to   you   from   Lord   Oxford ,   who   has   now   a   warm   fit   of fondness   for   you ,   but   the   heat   of   his   friendship   is   very   apt to   intermitt ,   however   at   this   present   writing   he   certainly   loves you   extreamly ,   the   Countess   is   gracious   to   the   last   degree ,   but   they hinder   our   Parties   abroad .   the   Duke   &   Dutchess   were   so obliging   as   to   carry   me   to   see   Windsor   Castle   last   week , It   is   so   delightfull   a   Place   &   so   fine   a   Palace   I   am   surprized his   Majesty   does   not   spend   his   Summers   there ,   I   should   think it   was   as   well   as   going   to   Hanover ,   we   were   much   disappointed by   a   shower   of   Rain   which   prevented   our   walking in   the   little   Park   as   we   had   proposed ,   but   that   project with   many   others   must   be   defer'd   till   we   are   alone again ;   the   same   day   we   were   at   Windsor   we   went   to see   a   little   Island   with   the   Thames   running   round   it , which   the   Duke   of   Marlborough   purchased   &   has   beautified at   the   expense   of   about   eight   thousand   pound ,   it   is   a pretty   thing ,   very   suitable   to   a   little   genius   &   a   small place ,   there   is   too   great   an   Embaras   of   buildings   upon it ,   the   finest   of   which   I   think   something   ressembling   the   Temple of   Janus ,   he   has   a   better   title   to   build   one   to   War   than   to   fame , for   he   has   got   a   Commission   but   Renown   I   believe   is what   he   will   never   gain .   he   is   spending   as   much   in   this Country   as   he   can ,   he   sent   out   a   few   days   ago   for   fourscore   Workmen   to   improve   a   Place   he   never   proposes to   live   at   after   the   old   Duchess   dies ,   his   Grandfather Now   saved   a   People   &   now   saved   a   groat ,   but   such   a   Warrior &   such   an   Oeconomist   is   this   Gentleman   he   will   never   save either .   The   sparks   of   life   &   vanity   are   at   length   extinguish'd   in Lady   Kaye ,   I   don't   hear   that   she   has   left   your   acquaintance Sr   John   any   thing ,   I   believe   every   thing   goes   to   her   daughter , it   is   very   happy   for   Lady   North   that   she   has   inherited   nothing from   her   but   her   Riches ,   to   whom   she   has   bequeath'd   the Residue   of   her   complexion   I   don't   know ,   she   had   some   tolerable features   as   eye   brows   lips   &   teeth   to   dispose   of ,   with   the   best Red   &   white ,   very   probably   her   Sister   Izabell   Lady   Clifton   will purchase   them .   Lady   Andover   told   me   in   a   letter   I   received   from her   last   post   that   Mrs   Botham   was   grown   very   grave ,   a great   Workwoman   &   an   Excellent   housewife ;   if   that   is   the   case Mr   Botham   preaches   to   those   of   his   household   as   well   as those   of   his   Parish ,   it   seems   she   designs   to   nurse   her   child herself ,   which   I   am   sorry   to   hear ,   for   the   poor   thing   will   certainly come   to   an   unfortunate   end ,   &   those   good   friends   who   seem'd to   promise   an   Encrease   of   family   to   Mr   Botham   may   by   their Romps   rob   him   of   an   heir .   I   am   charged   with   the   several compliments   of   Lord   &   Lady   Oxford ,   my   Lady   Dutchess ,   Lord Dupplin   &   Mr   John   Hay   to   you ,   I   think   the   civilest   thing   I   can say   my   self   will   be   what   will   put   an   End   to   all   other   impertinence so   Sir   be   assured   the   first   thing   I   think   tho   the   last thing   I   say   is   that   I   am Your   most   Dutiful And   most   Obedient   Daughter E   Robinson I   beg   my   Duty   to   my   Mother . 
BC_1740_EMONTAGU_MR_2	"Bullstrode   Nov Sir If   my   time   had   concurred   with   my   inclination to   write   to   you   and   my   readiness   to   return   thanks   for   the   pattern drawing , you   had   a   letter   from   me   long   ago ;   the   Apron   will   be   fit   for   a Dutchess   if   it   is   a   tolerable   imitation   of   the   pattern ;   her   Grace charges   me   to   make   Compliments   for   her   suitable   to   the   occasion , which   I   should   do ,   if   I   did   not   know   you   could   imagine   mille gentillesses   that   I   cannot   express :   So   please   to   dress   up   your thoughts   in   the   elegant   habit   of   your   own   phrase ,   &   then   they will   be   fit   for   the   Person   &   the   occasion ,   proper   for   the   most finish'd   Dutchess   &   most   finish'd   Apron .   Lord   Oxford   &   George Vertue   arrived   here   last   night   after   a   Ramble   which   the best   Geographer   could   hardly   describe ;   they   have   been   haunting Church   yards   &   reading   the   History   of   Mankind   upon   Grave   stones A   short   history ,   but   comprehensive   of   all   the   Generality   do , to   be   born   &   dye ,   self   love   orders   that   to   be   engraved   in   lasting Characters   which   Reason   would   wish   to   forget ,   what   worth   is Remembrance   without   praise ,   then   the   inscription   humbly begs   the   Gentle   Reader   to   weep   because   Tom   a   Stiles ,   born   , did   nothing   till   he   died ,   ,   when   he   had   nothing   else   to do ,   one   may   weep   indeed   to   see   Men   live   so   idle ,   &   dye   so vain ,   if   ever   I   have   an   Inscription   over   me   it   shall   be   without a   name ;   &   only   here   lies   one   whom ,   having   done   no   harm , no   one   shou'd   censure ,   &   having   done   no   good ,   no   one   can commend ,   &   for   past   folly   only   asks   oblivion ,   So   shall   my friends   be   discharged   of   neglect   &   my   self   of   partiality   to my   Memory .   Dr   Grey   is   employ'd   about   a   peice   of work   which   is   to   make   its   appearance   in   Publick   you   woud not   easily   guess   it   I   believe   tis   no   perplexity   upon   misteries , no   refutation   of   the   doctrine   of   transubstantiation ,   no Explanation   of   the   catechism ,   but   a   thing thing   for   which his   serious   qualifications   dont   seem   very   fit .   He   is   writing notes   upon   Hudibrass ;   his   dulness   may   be   a   proper   ballad For   Doggrel   It   is   better ,   however ,   his   stupidity   should   make jest   dull ,   than   serious   &   sacred   things   ridiculous ;   which , as   far   as   false   light   could   do   with   persons   of   giddy imagination ,   he   might   have   done   had   he   apply'd   his goose   quill   again   to   Controversy ,   to   an   honest   good   Man as   he   is ,   it   must   be   a   sort   of   comfort ,   did   he   know   it , that   his   folly   was   innocent .   We   are   all   shivering   with the   apprehension   of   another   hard   frost :   there   was   a   terrible storm   here   on   Saturday   night ,   if   I   had   the   descriptive   genius of   a   news   writer   I   could   give   you   a   magnificent   account   of the   damage   the   wind   did ,   but   not   having   a   hurly-burly imagination ,   nor   a   command   of   Similies   proper   for   a   Storm I   shall   not   be   able   ( according   to   the   Phrase   of   one   of   our tragedians )   "" to   deck   my   tale   with   decent   Horrors   I   beg my   duty   to   my   Mamma ,   who   I   hope   to   have   a   letter   from to   morrow ;   if   not   I   shall   write   to   her   next   post   as   I   proposed to   have   done   to   night ,   if   I   had   had   time .

BC_1740_EMONTAGU_MR_3	Bullstrode   Dec:   ye   Sir As   in   Town   I   interrupted   your   business   with my   letters   I   am   now   going   to   break   in   upon   your leisure ,   as   Ease   is   what   you   prefer   to   employment I   dont   know   whether   you   may   not   think   my last   impertinence   the   worst ,   especially   as   you have   an   Art   to   dignity   &   adorn   you   Leisure ,   Apropos Mrs   Pendarves   wants   much   to   see   you ,   to   take fresh   instruction   &   show   you   what   she   has   done   by the   assistance   of   that   you   have   already   given   her . I   wish   I   could   send   you   the   first   news   of   the   decision of   the   Westminster   Election ,   but   we   had   not   any account   of   it   to   day ,   Your   friends   have   behaved shamefully ,   they   have   deserted   just   when   they had   the   Majority   on   their   side ,   they   are   all   gone to   eat   brawn   in   the   Country   &   let   Political   matters take   care   of   themselves :   the   Princes   affair   is   to   be put   off   till   after   ye   Holydays .   The   Revolution   of Russia   was   brought   about   by   the   french ,   our Ministers   advised   the   Czars   party   of   the   Conspiracy Half   a   year   ago   but   they   thought   we   only   did   it   And   sent   a   List   of   the   Conspirators to   make   them   embrace   a   treaty   with   us   more   readily the   Czarina   Elizabeth   is   supposed   to   be   married to   Prince   Nariskini   who   is   now   at   Paris ,   she   is   a   very   Gallant   Lady , more   attach'd   to   Love   than   to   Empire ,   but   Fortune wooing   her   she   can   give   denial   to   no   Suitor ,   so   according to   the   Courtesy   of   her   Nature   yeilds   to   his   entreaty . Admiral   Haddock   says   he   thinks   he   is   not   a   match for   the   Spaniards   but   that   he   will   encounter them   &   sell   himself   as   dear   as   he   can ,   I   like not   this   whole   sale   trade   of   Ambition   where   you must   change   away   Honour   or   Life ,   witht   ye   first a   Man   is   worse   than   nothing ,   without   ye   second   nothing , for   I   think   ye   Existence   of   fame   is   very   chimerical , it   is   foolish   enough   to   dye   for   the   honour   of   three or   four   Syllables ,   &   at   last   the   difference   between   the Reputations   of   Alexander   the   Great   &   his   Bucephalus &   of   Don   Quixote   &   Rosinante   signifies   nothing   to   poor   Alexander or   Bucephalus .   Alderman   Parsons's   fine   Daughter   is   run away   with   a   Welldoest   Irishman   to   the   great   greif And   disappointment   of   that   true   Widow   her   Mother who   design'd   him   for   herself .   Dr   Mead's   son   is married   to   Miss   Nanny   Gore .   My   information   concerning Lord   Foley   was   wrong ,   for   it   seems   he   is   not   going to   be   married .   Mr   Harley   is   here   now ,   &   desires   his compliments   to   you .   Fevers   &   colds   are   much   about , of   the   latter   we   had   many   here ,   the   Children &   most   of   the   Servants   have   been   ill :   the   Dutchess to   my   great   satisfaction   is   perfectly   well .   We   go   to London   ye     of   january   ye     I   propose   to set   out   to   you   at   Horton .   I   beg   my   Duty   to my   Mamma   &   Love   to   my   Brors   &   Sister .

BC_1740_EMONTAGU_SS_2	My   Dearest   Sally After   a   thousand   disputes   with   my   own heart   I   have   never   been   able   to   determine   whether   I   would   have my   absence   less   disagreable   to   you   than   it   is ,   I   am   uneasy to   think   you   want   me ,   &   should   be   miserable   if   I   imagined you   did   not ,   to   be   forgot   by   ones   friends   is   a   thousand   times worse   than   to   be   separated   from   them ,   but   let   us   both   be content   as   we   can   with   the   unhappy   circumstance   of separation ,   let   me   be   content   that   I   am   remember'd   & my   Dear   Friend   know   no   absence   can   make   you   lose any   thing   of   my   tenderest   love   &   remembrance .

I   was   much   frighten'd ,   but thank   God   it   was   rather   from   my   own   Cowardice   than his   danger ,   I   suffer'd   much   from   my   fears   till   Morris Assured   me   his   fall   would   be   of   no   ill   consequence   the Dutchess   upon   this   as   on   all   other   occasions   show'd   much goodness   to   me .   I   have   been   much   in   a   hurry   lately   on wednesday   I   went   into   the   cold   Bath   which   agreed   with very   well   &   from   thence   the   Duke   &   Dutchess   Mr   Achard Lord   George   Bentinck ,   Lady   Throckmorton   Mrs   Collinwood   &   Sr Robert   Throc:   went   to   Mary   le   bon   gardens   to   breakfast , after   that   they   all   went   with   me   to   Zinckes   to set   for   my   picture   &   we   spent   the   Evening   at   Vauxhall , on   thursday   we   went   two   Coaches   &   Six   to   Kew   Richmond &   Petersom   Ld   Harringtons ,   where   I   could   turn   Pastorella with   great   pleasure   such     Prospects   from   the   most charming   Place   I   ever   saw   I   was   ready   to   cry   out O   Care   Selve   beate   :   I   would   tell   you   more   of   my meditations   but   the   bell   for   Supper   interrupts   me . Poor   Lord   Wallingford   is   dead   this   family   is   in   much affliction   for   him   &   the   Dutchess   cannot   see   Lady   W: which   adds   much   to   her   concern   he   dyed   suddenly   of the   Cramp   in   his   throat ,   we   Shall   stay   a   fortnight longer   in   Town .   I   am   very   sorry   my   Pappa   won't send   me   any   flowers   for   they   are   prettier   than   those of   Mrs   Pendarves's   gown   which   is   not   inimitable .

I   am   glad   you   enjoy   the   bloom   of   nature   at   Bath , London   beauties   are   cheifly   borrow'd   from   Art ,   the   very   Sun is   neglected   &   those   who   do   not   rise   till   he   is   setting   endeavour to   out   blaze   him   by   Candles ,   I   have   often   thought Nature   meant   to   point   out   Society   to   us   by   withdrawing half   the   year   the   comforts   of   Solitude ,   selflove   is still   the   principle   of   action   &   even   benevolent   beneficient Social   Man   but   seeks   another   to   bless   himself   ye   more ,   perhaps had   there   been   nothing   but   Summer   all   the   year   he   had never   forsaken   the   Woods ,   defence   sufficient   against   Zephir , &   Sun   beams   but   when   he   found   all   Coverings   fail   but   those of   Art   then   first   might   he   build   houses   to   defend   himself against   the   storms   &   outrages   of   Weather   &   once   secure   still wanting   to   be   happy   might   seek   company   &   assistance from   his   fellow   Creatures ,   necessity   craved   a   few   things   luxury wants   many ,   but   the   young   World   in   the   first   page   of   life had   not   learnt   the   arts   of   luxury   they   only   ask'd   the   necessaries of   life ,   for   Providence   which   made   us   for   each   other   has   denied   happiness   to   any   one   alone ,   escpecially   in   Winter When   half   the   Creation   retires   from   sight ,     Citties   please us   then   &   the   busy   humm   of   Men ;   when   the   fields   are in   their   freshest   liveries   Light   a   thousand   objects   divert   the mind .   I   am   at   present   my   happy   being   just   recoverd   from a   multitude   of   fears ,   I   was   apprehensive   I   should   be   sent for   to   Mount   Morris   immediately   before   I   could   have   the pleasure   of   seeing   my   Dear   friend   safe   from   the   pains &   perils   of   Child   birth ,   for   I   believe   I   told   you   I   was   in possession   of   a   Room   which   was   to   belong   to   a   little   Person as   soon   as   they   became   a   Citizen   of   the   World ,   but   now   it   is   agreed by   the   Supreme   Powers   in   Kent   that   I   shall   remain with   the   Dutchess   till   my   Pappa   comes   to   Town   which will   be   the   first   of   March ,   &   then   I   am   to   be   with   him &   my   Sister   is   to   come   up   &   stay   a   fortnight   with   us , how   happy   shall   I   be   to   have   by   Dutchess   &   my   Sister within   perhaps   a   few   hundred   yards   of   each   other ; I   shall   have   the   joy   of   seeing   her   Grace   as   well   as   ever   &   happier by   a   child   than   she   was   before ,   &   then   go   out   of   Town with   a   mind   free   enough   from   cares   to   enjoy   ease &   retirement .   I   shall   go   into   the   Country   the   beginning   of April   which   is   a   pleasant   Season   of   the   year ,   &   I   propose to   read   &   walk ,   &   ride   sometimes   but   not   very   often   for   I   tend rather   trust   two   of   my   own   legs   than   four   of   anothers , however   that   I   may   not   lose   the   health   I   have   gain'd I   will   make   a   Horse   my   guide   &   companion ;   I   am   very discontented   at   your   talking   of   not   coming   to   Town   till April ,   by   that   means   I   may   miss   the   seeing   you but   I   hope   Mrs   Freind   &   you   will   come   in   March the   Parliament   will   be   up   by   the   end   of   it   &   the Palaces   &   high   places   will   be   desolate ,   I   have   a   thousand things   to   say   to   you   which   I   do   not   care   to   put   upon paper ,   therefore   accuse   me   not   of   reserve   to   you   but of   caution   towards   the   curious   &   impertinent   who   will   open   a   thing because   it   is   seald   &   tell   it   because   it   is   a   secret . You   should   certainly   have   heard   from   if   I   had   not   been in   the   greatest   hurry   of   idleness   of   any   body   living ,   going always   into   a   Croud   because   I   was   not   wanted ,   visiting those   that   did   not   care   for   me   &   doing   a   hundred   things I   did   not   care   a   farthing   for   myself ,   I   have   yawn'd   at Assemblies   out   of   a   desire   of   keeping   good   company , done   many   things   I   disliked   to   show   I   had   a   tast ,   &   have Really   to   the   utmost   of   my   power   behaved   my   self   like a   genius   of   the   present   age ,   I   thank   my   stars   playing at   Cards   cannot   be   reckon'd   among   my   misdoings ,   the face   of   the   Queen   of   Spades   gives   me   the   vapours   & Spadille   Manille   Basto   which   better   than   the   three   Graces brighten   the   Countenance   of   a   Modern   Belle   give   me   no joy ,   I   am   sometimes   for   my   Sins   visited   with   the   loss   of   my neighbours   Sans   prendre   ,   who   from   the   losers   privilege   of talking   will   give   me   a   full   &   true   account   how   she lost   the   game   tho   I   cannot   instruct   her   how   to   win   another half   the   Monarchs   in   Christendom   might   be   deposed   with   noise     some   Ladies   make   if   the   King   called is   unguarded   or   happens   to   be   trump'd .   I   have   received the   money   for   the   trimming .   I   design   to   go   Miss   Grinfeild this   afternoon   I   had   a   sight   of   her   at   the   Riddotto   but there   was   such   a   prodigious   croud   it   was   impossible to   converse   with   any   one .   I   am   very   glad   indeed   that   you did   not   send   any   compliment   for   me   by   the   Miserable Gentleman   you   mention ,   a   messag   from   you   &   Mrs Freind   would   have   procured   a   kinder   smile   than   I should   otherwise   bestow   upon   him ,   Ward   may   very   possibly have   cured   him   of   Love   by   giving   his   pill ,   for   a   real   ill will   cure   an   imaginary   one ,   I   find   by   what   you   say   he 
BC_1741_EMONTAGU_ER	Dec   Madam I   had   your   commands   this   morning &   have   obey'd   them :   I   believe   the   Wars abroad   &   tumults   at   home   will   make the   publick   papers   worth   reading :   Dr Lee   has   Carried   his   Election   by   four ,   the Court   is   concern'd   at   it ,   the   K-   suspended even   his   dinner   ( an   action   of   as   great   importance as   any   done   in   the   Reigns   of   some   Monarch ) till   this   affair   between   Dr   Lee   &   Earle was   determin'd .   The   Westminster   Election will   now   be   carried   against   ye   Court , it   is   thought ,   &   Ld   Percival   will   undoubtedly be   chose   at   ye   new   Election :   the   friends of   Sir   R-   lament   that   now   he   will not   be   able   to   carry   any   of   ye   petitions but   where   the   right   is   on   his   side which   too   is   look'd   upon   by   them   as An   Unfortunate   thing   for   the   Kingdom in   general :   Sir   R   left   ye   House   in Chagrin   upon   losing   his   Chairman . The   D'ss   of   Marbro   is   not   dead   yet   but in   much   danger ,   she   has   ye   St   Anthony's fire   to   a   terrible   degree   &   will   have no   advice   but   such   as   her   Apothecary gives   her :   to   Mr   Spenser   she   has   bequeathed in   her   Will   thirty   thousand   a   year addition   to   what   he   has   already !   Ye   Dss of   Manchester   she   has   struck   out ,   how the   rest   of   her   enormous   fortune   is   disposed people   do   not   know   .   We   lost   two   of   our Divines   to   day :   Dr   Young   &   the   Dean   of Exeter ,   men   of   very   different   genius but   both   agreable   companions :   &   we shall   find   a   great   loss   of   them ,   for   in   the Country   people   who   do   not   want   the Supplies   of   news   &   chat   for   their   conversation mend   Society   extreamly :   they   were   call'd away   by   business   or   I   believe   they   would not   have   left   a   place   where   they   were so   well   pleased   &   so   much   liked . Mr   Horner   has   left   his   Estate   to   his Brother   &   a   legacy   of   ten   guineas   only to   Lady   Ilchester ;   to   his   widow   he   has lent   his   House   ( &   furniture )   in   the   Country for   her   life ,   with   a   Liberty   of   taking     bucks   &     Does   out   of   the   park ;   Ld   Ilchester will   be   disappointed   at   this ,   &   Mrs   Horner I   imagine   will   scarce   be   contented ,   but they   had   not   much   reason   to   expect   favour for   here   they   had   shown   no   regard .   I   am very   well   &   have   been   so   these   ten   days , a   longer   visit   than   health   has   made   me lately .   My   pen   is   vile   &   I   am   ashamed of   this   letter   pray   forgive   me my   carelessness In   sending   you   such   a     scrawl'd   peice of   paper   it   is   want   of   time   &   not   of   respect that   makes   me   write   thus .   I   am   sorry   you mistake   me   so   much   as   to   think   I   do not   wish   to   hear   from   you   often .   Pray   give my   Duty   to   my   Pappa   &   love   to   my   Bror Tom .

BC_1741_EMONTAGU_SS	Dear   Sister Having   already   wrote   a   long   letter   into the   family   &   being   summon'd   by   the   bell   to finish   my   Epistles   for   the   Evening   you   must excuse   me   if   I   write   but   a   few   lines .   I   was with   Cotes   this   morning   who   looks   well   &   is grown   fat ,   but   not   in   the   partial   manner proper   for   the   holy   State   of   Matrimony , she   loaded   me   with   excuses   to   you   for   not writing   &   with   promises   of   amendment ,   I   hope her   Resolution   will   avail   more   that   her Repentance ,   Miss   Knatchbull   is   ashamed   of being   lazy   &   desires   I   would   tell   you   so ,   if I   am   to   apologize   for   every   bodys   faults   I shall   never   want   business .   Mrs   Sawbridge appear'd   under   the   character   of   Miss   Brodnax To   avoid   the   expence   of   a   magnificent   appearance suitable   to   the   great   Character   of   Mr Jacob   Sawbridges   wife ,   The   importance   of a   Woman   to   herself   notwithstanding   her   insignificance to   the   rest   of   the   World   is   finely exemplified   in   her .   I   hope   she   will   be   a good   husewife   for   if   ever   nature   made   a Woman   for   no   other   purpose   it   is   her , homely   features   &   cheeks   of   sorry   grain may   serve   to   ply   the   Sampler   &   to   teize the   Housewifes   Wool   &   let   such   be   her occupation ,   the   Lillies   of   the   field   toil   not neither   do   they   spin ;   they   add   to   the   beauty of   the   World   by   themselves   but   sure   there is   a   duty   incumbent   upon   those   who   cannot look   well   to   do   well ,   and   not   to   break   in upon   Natures   Oeconomy   which   makes   nothing in   vain   as   they   can   be   of   no   pleasure   they may shou'd   be   of   some   use .   Pray   tell   Robert   I   hope he   caught   no   cold   but   I   was   very   uneasy   at his   going   such   a   bad   night .

BC_1742_EMONTAGU_ED_1	Allerthorpe   Aug   ye   Dear   Sir I   am   almost   afraid   you   have   flatter'd   yourself   with the   hopes   of   not   being   troubled   with   a   letter   this   Post   because   it   is   but   three days   since   you   left   me ;   time   indeed   goes   an   equal   pace   &   the   clock   a   regular Machine   measures   it   as   equally ,   but   it   is   differently   measured   by   our   minds as   we   are   in   different   situations ,   some   days   the   hours   run   laughing   by   so   swift &   merrily   we   do   not   count   their   steps ,   at   others ,   they   tread   a   heavy   march   & we   keep   a   long   account   of   tedious   delay :   thus   tho'   in   times ,   &   perhaps   your account ,   you   have   been   away   but   three   days ,   in   mine   you   have   been   absent long   enough   if   not   to   allow   me   to   complain ,   yet   sufficient   to   authorize   me   to   redress   it by   taking   this   way   of   conversing   with   you ;   it   is   said   Wives   will   always   have the   last   word ,   for   my   part   I   had   rather   have   the   first ,   for   I   shall   think it   the   best   end   of   speaking   to   induce   you   to   answer ,   it   is   cheifly   in this   hope   I   have   taken   up   my   pen   &   ink .   I   had   yesterday   in   the afternoon   the   favour   of   a   visit   from   Lady   Graham ,   Sir   Reginald   did not   come   with   her   knowing   you   was   at   Newcastle ;   I   like   her   Ladyship extreamly ,   she   is   very   conversable   &   wellbred ,   &   I   believe   a   very   good   Woman she   seems   to   me   more   lovely   than   a   quart   bottle ;   her   beauty   &   good Qualities   might   have   promised   a   better   Fate ;   I   felt   for   her   what   the   happy ( as   I   am )   are   least   apt   to   feel ,   compassion :   the   felicity   of   a   different   fortune has   taught   me   to   pitty   her   as   much   as   the   unhappiness   of   a   like   one could   have   done ;   I   could   not   help   thinking   if   Fate   had   reversed   our   fortunes and   sent   me   to   Norton   &   her   to   Allerthorp   how   I   had   suffer'd   by   the   change ; Happiness   which   is   the   proposed   end   of   all   our   pursuits   is   seldom   the   reward of   them ;   the   Ambitious   seek   for   it   in   power ,   the   Avaricious   in   Riches ,   the Profuse   in   expence ,   the   Vain   in   Pomp ,   the   Industrious   in   Labour ,   &   the   Idle in   Ease ;   but   power   has   many   disquietudes ,   Avarice   no   satisfaction ,   extravagance draws   after   it   much   inconvenience ,   &   Labour   &   Idleness   both   end   in   weariness of   Spirit ;   I   think   if   there   be   really   a   State   of   felicity   on   Earth   it   must   be in   the   Married   state Life   the   Persons   &   Interests   of   other   friends   may   be   divided , but   here   mutual   Interest   be Confidence   built   on   mutual   Interest   must   create   agreement of   opinion   &   of   wishes ,   a   competent   fortune   &   a   reasonable   mind ,   & merit &   well   deserving   towards   all   the   World   &   no   particular   dependance upon   any   in   it ,   must   surely   make   two   people   happy ,   but   for   a   few that   go   the   strait   Road   to   Happiness   how   many   deviate   to   the by   Roads   of   Humour ,   but &   how   very   fortunate   are   those   few   who   in the   Person   they   love   meet   with   the   Principles   of   honour   &   virtue   to   guide them   thro'   the   World ,   but   this   my   lot   so   happy   &   so   rare   shall   not   breed in   me   that   insolence   of   opinion   that   I   deserve   it ,   by but   I   will   still look   up   to   Heaven   &   you   with   gratitude   &   continual   acknowledgments . Lord   Castlecomar   was   on   the   Road   to   visit   you   yesterday ,   but   being inform'd   you   was   at   Newcastle   he   turn'd   back ,   &   sent   a   message that   he   would   wait   on   you   at   your   Return .   Young   Mrs   Carter And   her   pretty   little   Daughter   were   so   kind   as   to   dine   with   mee the   day   you   went   away ,   my   cold   was   very   bad   &   my   head   ach'd a   good   deal   that   I   was   as   bad   company   as   ever   passive   humility &   patience   endured ,   but   they   were   so   good   as   to   suffer   me   till   about six   o'clock   &   when   they   left   me   I   put   my   Cargo   of   youth   on   board the   Landau   &   went   out   a   airing ,   but   my   diversion   that   way   is at   present   suspended   by   a   petit   Demélé   the   wellfed   pertness   of   Harry pleased   to   have   with   my   Authority ,   when   Lady   Graham   was   here he   was   order'd   to   bring   in   the   Tea   table   which   since   I   hear   he did   not   approve ,   had   he   civilly   acquainted   me   with   his   scruples as   he   was   your   servant   I   had   certainly   given   way   to   them , but   not   suspecting   his   reluctance   to   such   a   triffle   I   told   him   to wait   as   he   was   going   out   of   the   Room   after   he   had   set   down the   table   however   he   ran   away ,   &   I   imagining   he   did   not hear   me   sent   after   him   &   he   obliging   sent   me   word   he would   not   wait   then   nor   any   other   time ;   I   thought   it   was not   very   proper   we   should   argue   this   point   or   such   other difficulties   as   to   his   punctilious   conscience   might   arise every   moment ,   so   indeed   I   sent   him   word   that   those   who wou'd   do   any   thing   for   me   must   do   every   thing ,   &   as   he wd   not   obey   all   my   orders   he   should   have   none ,   &   that he   must   keep   intirely   out   of   my   sight   till   your   Return that   he   had   ask'd   your   pardon   for   transgressing   your orders   which   were   to   wait   upon   me   till   Ned   came   back And   as   he   continues   to   be   saucy   &   declares   he   cares   not   as   there are   places   enough   to   be   had   & c   I   do   not   much   care   to   trust   him to   drive   me ,   till   you   are   here   to   keep   him   in   order ;   nevertheless   if you   would   have   me   make   use   of   him   I   will   surely   do   it ,   for   it is   much   more   my   business   to   obey   you   than   to   command   him ;   I   assure you   what   I   did   was   to   satisfy   my   dignity   &   not   my   Anger ,   for it   is   not   in   the   power   of   these   sort   of   people   to   provoke   me when   I   see   those   so   much   better   inform'd   by   Education   committing crimes   against   the   whole   World ,   &   these   poor   Creatures   only   omitt a   triffling   obligation   from   which   negligence   one   receives   no   hurt ; however   one   must   not   suffer   oneself   to   be   disobey'd   if   one would   ever   have   any   order   or   quiet   in   a   family ;   I   have   troubled you   with   more   upon   this   head   than   I   wd   have   done   because   it   is of   real   concern   to   me   that   you   should   be   convinced   I   am   not   ready to   find   fault   with   any   one   who   in   the   least   degree   may   have been   serviceable   to   you ,   but   Mr   Carter   will   tell   you   it   was   Harrys intention   to   behave   thus .   I   rejoyce   you   had   so   good   weather   for   yr   journey I   hope   your   business   will   give   you   as   little   trouble   as   is   possible ,   your fellow   traveller   is   certainly   the   best   assistant   in   the   World ,   he   is   that   righteous Man   of   whom   David   says   look   whatsoever   he   doeth   it   shall   prosper ! Our   boxes   came   safe ,   the   book   you   enquired   after   is   come   with   them , &   I   have   sent   you   the   papers   which   you   said   you   wanted ,   they   were unsealed   &   at   the   outside   of   the   book   so   I   imagined   I   might   look into   them ,   &   I   have   copy'd   them   that   if   they   should   be   lost   by my   sending   them   to   Newcastle   I   may   not   have   put   you   to   any inconvenience   by   doing   this   without   yr   orders .   I   think   one   of   the letters   which   came   by   this   Post   is   directed   by   yr   Sister ,   if there   is   inclosed   an   answer   to   the   letter   I   wrote   her ,   pray   read   it   & send   it   to   me   next   post .   My   Sister   desires   her   best   respects   to   you ,   the Children   their   most   thankfull   regards .

BC_1742_EMONTAGU_ED_2	Allerthorpe   Sept:   ye   Dear   Sir Mr   Carter   have having   said   to   you   every   thing that   is   necessary   &   to   the   purpose ,   it   may   seem   there   is no   occasion   I   should   add   any   thing   to   his   letter ,   but   how should   we   abridge   Life   of   its   pleasures   &   its   pomps if   we   limited   ourselves   to   what   is   merely   necessary ? this   scantiness   of   tast   has   reduced   Philosophers   to   a Tub   or   an   Old   Cloak ,   so   awkward   an   Equipage   that   the wise   men   of   these   days   seem   to   despise   every   thing that   looks   like   contracting   their   desires ,   &   appear   rather to   extend   them   to   every   unnecessary   &   unusefull addition .   I   have   not   sent   you   the   letters   that   came for   you   this   post ,   &   I   believe   it   is   better   not   to   hazard your   missing   them ,   as   you   will   do   if   you   set out   on   Sunday   from   Newcastle .   I   can   tell   you   I   have two   eyes   that   will   be   glad   to   see   you   at   your Return ,   I   have   quite   recover'd   the   weak   eye   by Putting   on   blisters   from   which   I   suffer d   less   inconvenience in   my   Ears   than   I   should   by   a   long   story   or   a   bad pun :   I   own   my   Ears   have   not   that   tender   sense of   charity   to   be   hurt   quite   as   much   by   a   little well   merited   censure   upon   my   Neighbours   as   they are   by   the   heat   of   a   blister ;   else   they   would   not suffer   more   now   than   from   the   venomous   breath of   common   fume   in   a   Place   of   polite   teatable   conversation . My   Sister   &   I   went   to   Lord   Aylesburys   yesterday , I   was   charm'd   with   the   Place ,   it   is   amazing   any one   could   be   so   pleased   &   so   out   of   their   wits   &   not make   verses ,   but   yet   I   did   not   compose   even   a Rhime ,   if   I   had   made   any   verses   they   must   have been   Pindarick ,   they   suit   best   with   the   genius   of the   Place ,   but   what   my   genius   is   fit   for   is   a thing   the   World   has   not   yet   found   out .   If   Mr Edwd   Carter   was   disengaged   I   would   go   to   Studley to   morrow ,   to   compare   the   places   while   Tanfield   is Fresh   in   my   memory ,   I   suppose   the   wild   graces   of this   will   be   quite   outdone   by   the   improved   &   cultivated beauties   of   Studley ,   but   for   my   part   I   believe I   should   prefer   a   Belle   Sauvage   to   an   accomplish'd Court   beauty :   all   our   pleasures   seem   too   much   prepared &   studied ,   but   those   we   find   in   a   meer   Natural Scene   appear   accidental ,   &   free   from   labour ,   fatigue , &   contrivance ,   all   which   are   the   Enemies   of   suprize &   preparers   of   Expectation ,   the   great   anticipator   of Human   joy .   I   hope   I   shall   hear   on   Sunday   that you   got   well   to   Newcastle ,   &   without   cold ,   for   my part   I   am   just   as   I   was   when   you   left   me . Mrs   Carter   has   had   a   fit   of   an   ague   &   Mr Carter   yesterday   got   a   fall   from   his   horse ,   you   see by   his   letter   he   is   well   but   he   had   a   little   bruised   his   side his   diligence   however   is   proof   against   accidents , he   has   been   riding   about   to   day   &   taking   his   usual doze   of   ease .   My   Paper   admonishes   me   to   conclude I   never   loved   admonition   in   my   life ,   but   advice   is   a wholesome   bitter   &   one   must   take   it ,   since   paper   time ,   & perhaps   your   patience   require   it   I   will   take   my   leave . Pray   accept   my   Sisters   complimts   &   make   mine   to   Mr Isaacson   his   family   &   Mr   Grey .   Adieu I   am   your   most   Faithfull &   affectionate   Wife E Montagu 
BC_1742_EMONTAGU_ED_3	  Oct   ye   My   Dear I   have   been   obliged   to   write   so   many   letters to   day   that   my   impertinence   is   exhausted   &   my   time also ,   therefore   you   need   not   be   under   the   apprehension of   a   long   letter .   I   have   sent   two   lettrs   that   were   directed to   you ,   one   I   believe   is   from   Mr   Wilson ,   &   can   be   of little   use ,   but   for   fear   of   a   mistake   I   have   enclosed it .   The   Letter   directed   to   Dr   Middleton   if   you   approve I   wd   beg   the   favour   of   you   to   frank   &   send   to   the   Post , but   I   should   be   glad   you   wd   first   take   the   trouble to   read   it ,   for   it   is   with   some   uneasiness   I   correspond with   the   very   wise ,   I   think   an   understanding   of   a middle   size   has   a   great   deal   of   trouble   in   Conversation between   reaching   to   those   above   it   &   stooping to   those   below   it ,   as   the   latter   is   done   with   more ease   &   better   Grace   I   think   I   wd   prefer   one of   the   highest   kind   if   I   might   chuse ,   but   as that   may   not   be   I   desire   as   few   occasions   as possible   to   stoop   or   Soar ,   &   so   shall   keep   as   much as   I   can   with   my   Equals :   if   you   dont   like the   letter   pray   burn   it ,   if   it   is   nonsense   I   can   write   another   as   good .   Tho'   I   venture   this   appeal   yr   good   opinion   more   than   any   ones ,   but   with   your judgment   for   me   you   will   have   mercy ,   &   find   an   excuse where   you   find   a   fault .   All   here   are   well .   I   had   a   letter   from Mrs   Donnellan   in   which   she   mentions   going   into   the   Country for   a   fortnight ,   therefore   I   should   be   sorry   you   should   have the   trouble   of   Calling   there   before   her   Return .   My   Sister   desires her   best   Respects .   The   Hours   will   appear   tedious   till   friday   that I   hear   you   got   well   to   Town ,   may   Health   &   happiness   be   your inseperable   Companions ,   as   they   will   surely   be   if   they   are   as   Constant to   you   as   the   good   wishes   of My   Dearest   Your   very   affectionate And   faithfull   Wife E   Montagu . If   Dr   Middleton   shd   send   his   translation of   Brutus   &   Cicero's   letters   to   me   in   Doverstreet pray   send   them   down   by   Wear .   The   Doctor   did not   tell   me   he   design'd   I   shd   have   them   but having   given   me     his   Greater   Work   I   think it   is   probable   he   may   add   this   as   it   does   in a   manner   compleat   it .

BC_1742_EMONTAGU_ED_4	Allerthorpe   ye     of   Nov: My   Dear I   had   determined   not   to   trouble   you   with   a   letter by   this   post ,   but   Mr   Ed:   Carter's   desiring   I   would   make   a   request   in his   name   to   you ,   I   think   gives   me   a   pretence   to   write   to   you   which you   very   prudently   avoid   by   not   answering   my   letters ;   at   least   a little   excuse   will   serve   when   on   the   side   of   inclination   so   I   will   not neglect   the   opportunity   this   offers   me   of   writing   to   you .   Young   Mr   Carter desired   I   would   tell   you   he   wish'd   to   be   made   a   Commissioner   of   the Land   Tax ,   &   to   distinguish   him   from   his   Father   would   be   presented thus ;   Edward   Carter   of   Theakson   an   Attorney   of   the   common pleas   at   Westminster   to   be   a   Commissioner   of   the   Land   Tax . he   dined   with   us ,   &   drank   tea   here ;   of   all   my   Neighbours   I   am much   most   glad   to   see   him ,   as   he   has   good   sense   agreable   behaviour , &   what   I   value   most ,   a   true   regard   &   friendship   for   you : the   attention   &   respect   he   pays   to   you   I   am   convinced   arises   from gratitude   &   true   Esteem ,   whereas   the   most   civility   that   one meets   with   is   rather   from   the   expectation   of   favours   to   come Than   the   Remembrance   of   those   already   received .   I   return   you thanks   for   sending   to   the   Duke   of   Portlands ,   I   had   a   letter   from the   Dutchess   the   Post   before   in   which   she   said   she   had   been   ill   but was   better .   I   would   request   of   you   not   to   take   a   footman that   has   not   certainly   had   the   Smallpox ,   for   their   falling sick   tho'   one   may   then   remove   them ,   gives   me   some   uneasiness , having   that   exquisite   sense   of   danger   that   the   Vulgar   call fear   &   Cowardice :   &   at   present   being   of   more   than   ordinary Consequence   I   should   be   a   little   disturb'd   at   such   an   accident . I   was   glad   to   hear   of   you   to   day   by   Griffith ,   but   I   think the   best   way   will   be   to   settle   a   Correspondence   between him   &   Du   four   &   then   no   love   will   be   lost ,   which   is   not   the case   at   present   while   my   kind   Epistles   are   thrown   by :   &   for any   thing   I   know   their   Correspondence   may   be   what   the french   call   tendre   &   animé   :   Pray   present   my   Duty   to   my   Father , I   should   have   been   glad   to   have   supp'd   in   Doverstreet   on wednesday   night   with   so   many   of   my   friends ;   however   time &   patience ,   or   indeed   time   without   patience ,   will   offer   me a   proper   opportunity   of   coming ,   to   Town .   You   will   not   expect I   should   send   you   any   news ,   all   I   know   here   is   that   if   it   does not   snow   it   generally   rains ,   &   when   it   does   neither   it   most certainly   freezes :   I   take   the   liberty   to   enclose   my   letter to   my   Brother ,   for   this   being   the   one   &   twentieth   letter   I   have wrote   since   you   went   away ,   franks   begin   to   grow   scarce . I   wish   you   would   send   me   down   a   Reemit   if   you   have any   opportunity .   Pray   desire   Griffith   to   set   the   large   oak Box   that   came   up   by   the   York   Carrier   in   a   dry   warm Room ,   or   my   cloaths   will   be   tarnish'd .   &   the   fortitude   of Woman   cannot   in   one   year   endure   to   lose   more   than   her complexion .   My   Sister   desires   her   compliments .   Farewell ,   my best   wishes   ever   attend   you ,   &   my   constant   remembrance   of   you every   hour   speaks   me   with   the   most   Entire   affection Yours E   Montagu

If   you   will   be   at   home   to   morrow   at   two   o'clock I   will   spend   an   hour   with   you ;   but   pray   send   me word   to   Jermynstreet   at   Eleven   whether   I   can   come to   you   without   meeting   any   person   at   Whitehall but   the   Duke ,   to   every   one   else   pray   deny   your   Dressing Room .   My   Mamma   tells   me   she   has   order'd   a   Servant to   carry   home   the   Sermons .   I   am   very   angry   you   should imagine   I   would   not   answer   your   letter .   I   must   put an   end   to   my   letter   for   my   Mamma   has   order'd   her   Coach .

BC_1742_EMONTAGU_MB_2	To   the   Duchess   of   Portland Allerthorpe   Thursday   ye   Aug:=st I   do   verily   believe   your   Grace   half   condemns me   for   not   having   wrote   before   to   you ;   but   I   will   give your   curiosity   ample   satisfaction ,   &   your   indignation as   entire   pacification ,   before   I   have   finish'd   my letter .   That   I   did   not   write   upon   the   Road   is   very accountable ,   first   I   was   lazy ,   which   is   sometimes   the case ;   secondly ,   I   was   stupid ,   which   I   will   not   take   upon me   to   say   is   not   always   the   case ;   but   the   truth   is , I   was   dull   without   a   zest   of   the   pert   as   impertinent , &   so   thirdly   &   lastly ,   I   said   nothing   because   I   had nothing   to   say .   On   Tuesday   I   arrived   at   this   place , not   tired   of   my   journey ,   but   satisfied   therewith . As   far   as   Nottingham   you   will   travel   very   soon , &   then   as   far   as   Doncaster ,   therefore   it   will   be   but impertinent   to   give   you   an   account   of   the   Road , or   any   thing   concerning   it ;   I   will   only   tell   your Grace   I   saw   Nottingham   Castle ,   where   there   is beauty   &   magnificence   worthy   the   wisedom   &   the Riches   of   yr your   Ancestors .   As   we   came   nearer   to this   Place   the   Country   grew   more   wild ,   but   not less   beautifull ;   we   came   thro'   Some   Rivers   that charm'd   me   beyond   all   things :   whether   they   were once   melting   Maids   or   weeping   Lovers ,   I   don't   know , but   since   the   World   is   grown   Laborious   those   idle   Tales   are forgotten   which   once   were   sung   to   the   happy   Shepards' Oaten   Reed .   I   am   surprized   you   do   not   fix   a   time for   going   into   the   Country .   I   Imagine   you   will   spend your   Christmas   there ;   but   did   ever   any   one   go   into the   Country   above   a   hundred   miles   to   gather   snowdrops , or   take   a   Winters   blast ,   we   have   at   present very   fine   weather ,   the   Sun   gilds   every   object ,   & I   assure   you   it   is   the   only   fine   thing   we   have here ,   for   the   House   is   old   &   not   handsome :   it   is very   convenient ,   &   the   situation   extreamly   pleasant . We   found   the   finest   peaches   nectarines   & apricots   that   I   have   ever   eat :   your   Grace   will   think I   mean   turnips ,   Carrots ,   &   parsnips ;   but   really   &   truly they   are   apricots ,   peaches ,   &   nectarines .   Tomorrow ,   I believe   will   be   one   of   the   happiest   days   I   ever spent ,   I   am   to   go   to   fetch   my   Brothers   from   School ; how   delightfull   will   be   such   a   meeting   after   so many   years   separation .   I   am   glad   Dup   remembers   no   more His   Labour   &   Sorrow   for   joy   that   a   Male   child   is born   into   the   World :   I   think   no   Man   better   deserves a   Child ;   the   End   justifies   the   means ,   else   what should   one   say   for   his   extream extreme ,   surprizing ,   amazing , fondness   for   the   Lady ,   it   is   very   indelicate   to   be   so fond   of   all   that   composition   of   julep ,   jalep ,   pill , &   bolus ,   her   breath   must   smells smell   like   a   gallipot   of   physick ,   & a   box   of   salve ,   endearing   charms   to   an   Apothecary but   un   peu   degôutant   to   a   Man   of   Quality .   to   bring such   a   Slovenly   Corse   betwixt   the   Wind   &   his Nobility !   I   am   glad   there   was   a   child   but   pray was   there   not   a   little   Souterkin   for   the   joy   of the   Ladys   Relations ?   Pray ,   is   the   Dupplinnetto   so like   his   Father   as   to   talk   to   the   first   ear   he   meets ? I   imagine   my   Lady   will   never   suffer   it   to   learn to   walk ,   because   that   is   too   rude   an   exercise I   undoubtedly imagine   when   it   is   eight   years   old ,   instead   of   going to   Westminster   school ,   it   will   be   sent   to   Apothecaries Hall ,   &   there   have   its   stomach   improved   till   it   is able   to   digest   Album   Græcum .   I   am   glad   Ld   Dupp enjoys   his   Liberty   &   Leisure ,   the   rest rèpose   a   Gentleman   takes after   the   honours   of   sending   a   Son   into   the   World may   be   call'd   Ease   with   dignity .   I   had   a   letter   from Lady   Andover   the   night   I   came   here ;   yr   Graces   too   was here   before   me   &   I   assure   you   this   is   the   first   post since   I   came   that   I   could   write ,   for   it   goes   out   only thrice   a   week   &   on   tuesday   I   came   too   late   to set   down   to   write .   We   perform'd   our   journey   in   Six days   with   very   easy   Stages .   I   am   sorry   for   Lady   Belllope , I   wish   her   grief   may   not   have   any   bad   consequences . Your   Grace   was   very   good   in   sending   me   news   of   the India   Ships .   I   have   heard   nothing   yet   of   my   Brother but   he   does   not   know   where   I   am .   the   Post   is going   but ,   company ,   business   &   many   letters   of   necessity have   taken   up   so   much   of   my   time   that I   have   not   had   enough   to   write   a   longer   letter but   in   a   very   few   days   you   shall   have   a   longer letter .

BC_1742_EMONTAGU_MB_3	Allerthorpe   Sept:   ye   Madam Good   news   coming   by   so   welcome   a   hand   gave   me me   a   joy   I   can   no   more   express   than   I   can   the   thousand   obligations   I   have to   your   Grace ,   &   the   gratitude   I   feel   for   them ;   your   letter   gave   me   the first   account   of   my   Brothers   being   arrived   in   good   health ,   the   kind manner   in   which   you   enquired   after   him   for   me   gives   me   infinite pleasure ,   but   I   will   say   no   more   of   this   as   I   know   you   love   to   oblige &   hate   to   be   thank'd .   I   had   certainly   wrote   to   your   Grace   last   post but   for   a   mistake   in   my   Arithmetick   in   computing   when   you would   arrive   at   Welbeck ,   where   I   hope   you   have   the   satisfaction of   finding   Lady   Oxford   in   good   health ,   I   imagine   her   Ladyships Seat   is   magnificent ,   the   situation   fine   &   every   thing   about   you delightfull ,   but   what   will   most   please   you   will   be   Lady   Oxfords company :   You   reproach   me   with   writing   short   sentences   &   short letters   when   my   Visitors   are   gone ,   alass   my   Lady   Dutchess   if   any   thing could   make   me   fond   of   silence   or   concise   expression   it   would   be   Country visitors ,   yet   for   all   I   say   this   do   not   imagine   I   deliver   my   self   over to   absent   Reverie ,   for   I   assure   you   I   am   as   civil   as   a   Grocers wife   the   first   day   her   Husband   is   Mayor   of   a   Corporation ,   as   for Politeness   it   is   that   je   ne   scai   quoi   of   behaviour   composed   of numberless   nameless   mysteries   which   I   do   not   understand ,   but   for civility   it   is   a   wearisome   zeal   of   complaisance   that   any   one with   my   spirits   may   fatigue   their   Neighbours   with ;   I   know   a A   Person   who   will   sweat   with   civility   all   the   Christmas   Holidays &   would   make   themselves   hoarse   with   complimenting   tho'   they &   their   company   were   in   the   whispering   Gallery   at   St   Pauls ,   for my me   indeed   I   would   not   put   myself   into   a   galloping   consumption of   complaisance ,   &   for   that   reason   was   always   reckon'd   by   them tardy   in   my   civilities :   for   my   part   I   wish   the   Thermometer   of   peoples behaviour   would   rise   no   higher   than   temperate   for   that   excessive   heat of   complaisance   is   very   overcoming .   I   do   most   heartily   wish   her   Lady C-   R   may   not   lose   that   singular   Man   her   Lover ,   I   think   the loss   would   be   irreparable ,   Mr   Tattle   all   over   sweet   as   she   describes   him ,   if   he   has   wit   equal   to   his   judgment   must   be   a   very agreable   companion ,   the   present   possession   of   a   Beau   is   to   one of   her   impatience   much   better   than   a   Reversion   of   an   Ape , the   shadow   of   a   shadow   is   no   material   thing   'tis   sure :   but   what sort   of   a   Man   is   this ?   was   he   bred   a   tooth   scraper   or   a carver   in   Ivory ,   for   certainly   she   must   have   taken   him   in by   her teeth ?   he   is   not   the   first   Ass   that   was   slain   by   a   jawbone   but   the jawbone   of   an   Ass   has   kill'd   a   Lion   so   far   the   weapon   &   the death   is   honorable .   I   am   very   sorry   for   what   your   Grace   tells me   of   the   probability   of   Mrs   Percivals   going   to   Ireland ,   then   poor Donn   will   go   for   ever ;   for   her   Brother   will   perswade   her   to   stay   with him ,   indeed   he   is   that   sort   of   friend   to   whom   one   ought   to   deny   nothing , but   it   is   grievous   to   us   to   part   with   her .   I   wrote   her   a   long Letter   last   tuesday   which   I   hope   she   has   received   by   this   time . I   shall   be   extreamly   glad   to   hear   your   Grace   had   a   pleasant journey   to   Welbeck ,   &   that   the   little   ones   are   well   after   change of   air ,   I   dare   say   they   are   mighty   happy   in with   their   present situation :   I   hope   you   will   have   time   to   afford   me   one   line tho'   certainly   all   the   Country   will   be   paying   their   complimts to   Lady   Oxford ,   but   that   won't   take   up   your   leisure   as much   as   when   you   are   the   Lady   of   the   House ,   for   there   it   is necessary   to   be   every   moment   with   people ,   &   one   must   be   sitting in   form   to   receive   them   half   an   hour   before   they   arrive . I   would   beg   my   best   respects   to   Lady   Oxford   for   whom   I   have   so   much esteem   I   dare   not   trouble   her   with   a   longer   compliment . Mr   Montagu   &   my   Sister   beg   their   complimts   to   yr   Grace   Lord   Duke ,   mine   too   attend   his   Grace   &   Mr   Achard .   I   have   quite quite   got   the   better   of   my   cold   &   am   perfectly   well ,   that   last   Article seems   of   very   little   consequence   but   they   must   be   happy if   they   are   not   important   who   have   the   honour   of   being Your   Graces Most   Obedient And   most   Faithfull   Humble   Sert E Montagu 
BC_1742_EMONTAGU_MB_4	    nov My   Dearest   Lady   Dutchess It   gives   me   great   anxiety   when I   reflect   how   long   it   is   since   I   have   had the   happiness   of   hearing   from   your   Grace , I   think   I   have   wrote   You   four   letters   since I   had   one   from   you ,   I   do   not   say   this   by way   of   reproach   but   to   excuse   my   desiring a   line   from   you   by   next   post ,   for   I   have a   thousand   anxious   cares   for   you   that   whisper fears   in   my   Ears .   I   wrote   last   post   to   Mr Montagu   to   desire   him   to   send   to   Whitehall to   enquire   after   you   &   the   family ;   every one   on   whom   yr   happiness   depends   is dear   to   me .   My   health   is   better ,   but   my mind   is   ill   at   ease ,   I   hope   a   line   from   you will   give   me   the   eternal   joy   &   cure   my present   uneasiness   which   is   great   on   your account .   I   have   taken   a   medicine   of   Dr   Sandys   to   day that   writing   does   not   well   agree   with   ,   therefore   excuse   this short   letter ,   &   believe   me   as   the   anxiety   of   my   heart   does now   so   strongly   speak   me Your   Graces Most   affectionate   &   Sincere   Friend And   Gratefull   Humble   Servant E   Montagu 
BC_1742_EMONTAGU_MR	Sir I   thought   it   would   be   agreable   to   you   to   have   an   account of   the   mighty   &   important   proceedings   of   both   Houses yesterday   so   I   have   sent   you   the   question   which   was   Debated in   Both   Houses   with   a   good   deal   of   Warmth ,   it   was brought   into   ye   House   of   Lords   by   Ld   Cartaret   who   spoke two   Hours   upon in   opening .   Ld   Carslile   &   Ld   Westmorland spoke   with   great   warmth   &   Ld   Carslile   was   very   bitter . Ld   Hallifax   seconded   Ld   Cartaret ,   Ld   Talbot   said   in   answer to   ye   Duke   of   Marbroughs   motion   ( that   it   might   be voted   that   an   attempt   to   inflict   any   kind   of   punisht & c   & c )   that   all he   wd   not   say   that   all   Persons   were   influenced that   spoke   in   favour   of   Sir   Robert   that   they   appear'd   to be   so   &   upon   being   call'd   to   order   he   said   with   heat   that he   was   used   to   speak   truth ,   &   that   he   did   believe   ( by the   most   Sacred   oath )   that   they   were   so   &   that   he   was ready   to   give   any   Man   satisfaction   that   wd   require   it . All   moderate   Men   voted   with   the   majority   in   both   Houses . Lord   Cornbury   &   Mr   Harley     spoke   in   favour   of   Sir R   the   latter   said   that   tho'   sir   R   had   persued   a   relation of   his   without   evidence   &   caused   his   imprisonment   &   thereby the   shortening   of   his   Life   he   coud   not   as   he   had   differed from   him   in   all   his   measures   copy   him   in   that   & so   withdrew   wth   his   Brother   &   many   others   who   had   great disobligations   to   the   M-   Mr   Skippen   wd   not   vote   against the   great   Man   for   it   seems   there   was   no   proof   nor   Evidence of   the   accusations .   I   think   the   Majority   was     against     in the   House   of   Commons   many   of   the   Country   interest   did   not   vote at   all ;   they   did   not   break   up   till   three   the   House   of   Lords at   one   o'clock   in   the   morning .   Mr   Sandys   opend   very well   &   Mr   Ste   Fox   spoke   on   the   other   side   extreamly   well . by   next   post   I   may   be   able   to   give   you   a   further   acct   of the   matter   but   this   is   all   I   have   yet   heard   for   the Members   of   Parlt   are   half   asleep   to   day .   Ld   I   am   Sir Your   most   dutifull   -- 
BC_1743_EMONTAGU_ED	London ,   - My   Dearest I   cannot   possibly   lose   an   opportunity of   pleasing   myself   with   writing   to   you ;   the   absence of     those   we   love   is   always   a   pain   but   may be   alleviated   by   conversing   with   pen   &   ink ,   by   which we   convey   some   of   our   thoughts   tho'   many   perish in   silence .   I   was   very   glad   to   hear   you   got   safe to   St   Albans ,   every   thing   that   concerns   you is   of   the   utmost   importance   to   me ,   but   I   am   not so   unreasonable   as   to   desire   to   hear   from   you when   you   are   engaged   ( as   you   must   be )   in the   trouble   &   perplexity   of   business ,   therefore   I desire   you   will   let   Wear   write   whenever   it is   not   convenient   to   you   to   do   it .   I   have   been this   morning   with   my   poor   friend   the   Dutchess of   Portland .   I   met   her   yesterday   in   my   airing our   short   interview   broke   the   ice ,   that   to   day she   received   me   with   less   disorder   than   I could   have   hoped ,   we   talk'd   of   all   subjects   but the   unhappy   one ,   &   tho'   our   conversation   had nothing   of   melancholly   it   had   a   constraint in   it   little   less   painfull   to   the   heart ,   I   heard her   teach   her   little   Son   to   read ,   the   Childs   coming into   the   Room   disconcerted   us   both   a   good   deal , the   poor   boy   was   innocent   &   ignorant   of the   pain   he   gave ,   &   taking   us   both   by   the hand   smiled   with   such   a   resemblance   of his   departed   Sister   as   struck   me   a   good   deal , &   the   poor   Woman   had   some   occasion   for her   strength   of   mind ;   in   every   point   of   View she   appears   beautifull ;   I   hope   her   Virtue   will rather   be   manifested   in   Prosperity   than   try'd with   adversity :   but   there   is   I   fear   a   portion of   misery   entail'd   on   all   the   Sons   of   Men &   such   is   the   Law   of   Nature   each   must take   their   share ;   but   this   is   a   melancholly subject ,   &   doubly   so   to   me ,   since   not   your Virtue ,   nor   my   wishes   can   secure   you   from the   accidents   of &   ills   of   Life ;   my   anxious   fears when   I   am   to   part   with   you   betray   weakness &   want   of   Courage ,   but   they   declare   strong affection   &   much   Love ,   &   I   hope   you   will   forgive a   tenderness   you   cannot   approve   nor   I   can conquer .   I   dined   at   Lady   Weargs   &   stay'd till   almost   ten   o'clock   to   night ,   your   Sister went   &   returned   with   me .   Mr   Medows Sister   is   better .   I   hear   Mr   Isaacson   will soon   be   at   Newcastle .   My   Sister   &   my   Father came   to   Town   abt   two   hours   after   you   left me ;   I   fear   you   could   perceive   it   was   no Improper   Season   for   a   comforter   to   come ,   yr   Sister indeed   was   very   good   &   stay'd   with   me   till my   mind   was   a   little   composed   &   the arrival   of   my   Sister   revived   me .   Pray   make my   complimts   to   the   very   good   people   you are   with ,   accept   my   Sisters ,   &   as   time   will allow   to   add   no   more ,   believe   me ,   tho'   time &   words   fall   short   to   tell   it   you Ever   faithfully   affectionately &   Gratefully   Yours E   Montagu ye     Saturday 
BC_1744_EMONTAGU_AD	june   ye     My   Dear   friend You   will   be   glad   to   hear   my   boy is   wean'd   without   costing   him   any   tears ,   or   his Mother   any   Sighs :   He   is   as   contented   (   now   he   finds he   cannot   have   any   thing   better )   with   milk   porridge as   ever   he   was   with   the   other   manner   of Taking   his   Nourishment ,   in   short   health   gives a   Relish   to   all   kinds   of   fare ,   &   children   who know   nothing   better   than   Ease   are   sure   to   be merry   when   they   are   not   in   pain ,   it   is   owing   to our   Refinements   that   we   are   not   always   as   easily Contented .   The   Country   is   now   extreamly   delightfull , all   Nature   is   in   bloom ,   every   Being   joyous   &   happy ,   it   seems to   me   impossible   that   any   Citizen   of   so   fair   a World   should   harbour   any   Gloomy   Care   in   their   breast It   is   a   vain   pretence   we   make   to   delicacy   &   Taste   while we   prefer   a   Dirty   Town   to   the   Country   in   the   fine Season ;   All   the   arts   of   Luxury   cannot   invent   any Pleasures   equal   to   what   one   receives   from   soft   Air , Moderate   Sunshine ,   a   Gay   Scene   of   Prospect ,   & the   musick   of   the   feather'd   songsters ;   Sir   William Temple   said   his   three   wishes   were   Health ,   peace , &   fair   Weather ,   I   have   often   thought   that   saying not   the   least   wise   of   many   of   his   admired   Sentences Some   may   despise   wishes   that   include   neither Riches   power   or nor   fame ,   but   to   me   He   appears a   Fine   philosopher   above   the   admiration   of those   pernicious   or   pompous   trifles   we   call   great , &   as   one   who   only   desired   an   agreable   leisure in   which   to   think   &   study ,   as   if   he   thought look'd   upon knowledge   to   be   the   Greatest   Riches ;   The   Government of   himself   the   best   Exercise   of   power ,   &   innocence   &   Virtue the   best   character ;   beyond   the   Vulgar   applause &   Popular   fame   attendant   on   Successfull   tho unrighteous   ambition .   I   have   often   thought   if   every one   was   to   tell   their   real   wishes   Corisca   wd no   longer   be   thought   Ridiculous ,   there   are Such   trifling   &   monstrous   follies   in   the   World , that   were   it   not   for   the   mischeivous   Errors of   the   Mighty   ( which   turn   Human   Life to   a   Tragedy )   it   would   be   a   farce .   How   few would   chuse   Sir   W:   Temples   Serene   Fate ! I   have   pass'd   my   time   here   without   much   interruption from   Company ,   my   little   Man   has   been   my cheif   Companion ,   he   is   finely   improved ,   &   it   gives me   a   double   pleasure   to   observe   it   because   I   know the   joy   it   will   give   his   good   Father ,   the happiness   that   is   shared   with   a   friend   is   said   to give   double   delight ,   I   think   we   may   go   farther &   say   perfect   delight .   I   expect   Mr   Montagu   here on   monday   &   I   think   I   am   as   impatient   to   show him   his   fine   boy   as   to   see   him   my   self .   I   wrote to   Mrs   Dettemere   ( the   poor   Woman   you   kindly   relieved ) to   bring   two   of   her   work'd   Caps   to   you ,   as   you said   you   wd   be   so   good   as   to   endeavour   to   dispose of   them   for   her .   if   you   could   easily   do   it :   I   dare say   your   Servants   who   are   used   to   open   a   Hospitable Door   to   the   Poor   will   admit   her :   unfortunate   merit is   modest   &   too   easily   discouraged ,   but   there   is   no fear   she   should   meet   with   any   discouragement in   the   House   of   Charity :   &   I   suppose   she   will ask   for   you   if   you   are   at   leisure   &   if   not   leave   her Caps .   Your   Bounty ,   the   Dutchess   of   Portlands ,   &   some others   have   put   her   in   some   Spirits ,   but   when people   have   been   long   unhappy   without any   guilt   of   their   own   it   is   enough   to   make them   despond ,   &   doubt   of   a   Providence ,   however this   Poor   Woman   is   patient   &   resign'd   to   affliction &   tho'   all   apparent   Circumstances   have   turnd contrary   to   her ,   yet   owns   an   invisible   assistance from   Heaven   that   has   supported   her   under   them   all . I   have   a   thousand   letters   to   write   or   perhaps this   wd   be   still   longer .   My   Compliments   to   Mr &   Mrs   Percival   &   Dr   Donnellan :   I   forgot   to   tell   him when   I   saw   him   last   that   Col   Graham   has   two Horses   to   sell ,   if   they   have   the   Coll's   courage they   will   not   start ,   but   if   they   have   his Spirits   they   will   run   away   with   him   and   leap   over Bounds   your   Brother   wd   not   pass ,   so   let him   inquire   into   ye   Characters   of   the   Horses for   I   only   know   they   are   to   be   sold . 
BC_1744_EMONTAGU_MB	Allerthorpe .   Sebtr .   I   am   much   obliged   to   my   Dear   friend for   her   tender   concern   for   me ;   I   would   have   wrote   to you   before ,   but   I   could   not   command   my   thoughts so   as   to   write   what   might   be   understood .   I   am well   enough   as   to   health   of   Body ,   but ,   God   knows , the   Sickness   of   the   Soul   is   far   worse ;   however as   so   many   good   friends   interest   themselves   for   me , I   am   glad   I   am   not   ill .   I   know   it   is   my   duty   to   be resign'd   &   to   submit ;   many ,   far   more   deserving   than   I   am , have   been   as   unfortunate .   I   hope   Time   will   bring   me comfort ,   I   will   assist   it   with   my   best   endeavours ; it   is   in   afflictions ,   like   mine ,   that   Reason   ought to   exert   exert   itself ,   else   one   should   fall   beneath   the Stroke .   I   apply   my   self   to   Reading   as   much   as I   can ,   &   I   find   it   does   me   service .   Poor   Mr   Montagu shews   me   an   example   of   patience   &   fortitude , &   endeavours   to   comfort   me ,   tho though   undoubtedly   he feels   as   much   Sorrow   as   I   can   do ,   for   he   loved his   Child   as   much   as   ever   Parent   could   do . My   Sister   has   been   of   great   service   to   me ; &   on   this ,   as   all   other   occasions ,   a   most   tender   friend . I   am   much   obliged   to   you   for   wishing   yourself   with   so unhappy   a   companion ,   yr   conversation   wd   would   be   a   cordial to   my   Spirits ,   but   I   should   be   afraid   of   being   otherwise   to yours .   Adieu   ;   think   of   me   as   Seldom   as   You   can ,   &   when   you   do , remember   I   am   patient ,   &   hope   that   same   Providence   that snatch'd   this   Dear   Blessing   from   me   may   Give   me   others , if   not   I   will   endeavour   to   be   content   if   I   may   not   be   happy . Heaven   Preserve   you ,   &   your   Dear   precious   Babes ;   thank   God you   are   far   removed   from   my   misfortune ;   &   hardly   can fear   to   be   Bereft   of   All . I   am , ever   your   Grace's   most   affectionate E M:

BC_1747_EMONTAGU_MB_1	"Sandleford     of   july Madam I   have   often   taken   up   my   pen   &   dipped   it in   ink ,   &   prepared   to   dedicate   &   address   its   labours   to   your   Grace , &   have   as   often ,   been   prevented ;   &   the   tide   of   ink   has   either   been stopp'd   by   some   accident ,   or   turn'd   from   its   proper   channel to   rush   thro   letters   of   business ,   or   flow   in   Compliments   & Congratulations ,   for   of   all   these   I   have   had   many   to   write   lately . then ,   Madam ,   we   farmers   &   Housewives   have   many   little cares ;   a   black   cloud   that   threatens   the   Hay ,   a   clap   of thunder   that   may   spoil   the   Cream ,   an   East   Wind   that brings   blast   to   our   Grain ,   Can   all   darken   the   imagination , &   spoil   the   Conceits   of   the   Children   of   Care .   I   hope   your   Grace received   a   great   deal   of   pleasure   at   Sevenoak Sevenoaks   &   found   &   left your   friend   in   good   health :   I   was   unlucky   to   leave   Town the   day   before   you   return'd   to   it ,   but   so   the   perverse   fates decreed .   Mrs   Donnellan   &   I   had   some   Adventures   at   the   Inn , which   I   think   deserve   relation ,   we   had   spent   the   fire   of our   Conversation ,   &   were   in   serious ,   sober ,   &   deliberate discourse ,   when   Mrs   Ann   Walton   who   was   at   the   Inn , ( with   the   late   Mrs   Warren   now   Mrs   Honywood   rush'd   into the   Room ,   let   off   a   volly   of   Compliments   on   our   happy Rencontre   ,   express'd   a   desire   to   inform   us   of   the   Pomps &   Vanities   of   Mrs   Honywood's   Wedding ,   the   number   &   richness of   her   Cloaths ,   the   quantity ,   lustre ,   &   form   of   her   jewels ; with   a   most   comprehensive   et   cetera   of   Equipage ,   Servants , Plumbcake   feasts ,   &   so   on .   the   benevolent   communicativeness of   her   temper ,   urged   her   on   to   describe   this   with   such impetuous   speed ,   such   earnest   violence ,   &   uninterrupted force ,   that   Poor   Donn ,   &   I ,   could   hardly   insert   a   note   of Admiration ;   the   most   we   could   possible possibly   introduce   was ah !   while   this   vocal   musick   was   playing   the   thorough Base ,   the   door   again   opend   &   let   in   Mrs   Hassel ,   the   late   Ld Stawel's   daughter ;   she   came   ( as   says   the   Poet )   ( Like   lightning   thro   /   a   Cloud Shining   bright ,   &   speaking   loud . )   &   with   a   Voice   more   in   times audible ,   &   discourse   more   voluble ,   than   the   other ,   went   on without   interruption ,   pause ,   or   delay ,   till   Mrs   Honywood summon'd   her   to   play   at   Commerce .   now   for   a   Simile   to   describe the   silence   &   dullness   that   appear'd   on   their   departure ;   the blowing   off   of   a   Whirlwind ,   the   Ceasing   of   Thunder ,   a   storm of   Hail   going   off   in   a   soft   Shower ,   even   a   Conjuror   running away   with   one   Corner   of   a   House ,   &   leaving   the   Inhabitants of   the   other   in   Dumb   astonishment ,   &   Silent   fear ,   are   poor Emblems ,   &   faint   comparisons ,   of   the   change   that   appeard In   the   Room   at   our   Inn .   We   were   so   amazed   &   Confounded , we   stared   at   each   other ,   and   asked   whether   it   was they   were "" Spirits   blest ,   or   Goblins   Damned ""   wish'd   we   had   spoke   to   it them   ;   enquired whether   it they   vanish'd   at   the   Crowing   of   the   Cock ,   or   the   calling of   the   Drawer .   at   last ,   hearing   it   was   a something   that   had   had   two husbands ,   we   determined   it   must   be   flesh   &   blood ,   grew more   easy ,   &   drank   our   tea .   I   don't   know   whether   your   Grace knows   the   History   of   Mrs   Hassel ;   she   was   handsome   and   very rich ,   &   married   first   to   a   fugitive   Papist   Priest ,   who   dying , she   lamented   for   him   so   violently   that   her   grief   was   soon   worn out ,   &   she   married   a   Major   Hassel .   Mrs   Warren   too   dispatched her   Sorrow   in   a   reasonable   time ,   &   as   soon   as   she   had   pulled   off the   Widows   Veil   &   Weeds ,   put   on   her   Bridal   Garments , is   now   gone   into   Yorkshire   with   her   new   Husband .   Don   Quixote could   not   have   desired   a   Better   Adventure   than   the   meeting these   extraordinary   Persons ,   in   such   extraordinary   Spirits ,   on   so extraordinary   an   occasion .   I   think   my   Ancestor ,   surnamed Crusoe ,   Voyaged   thro'   Lands   unknown   to   less   purpose   than I   pass'd   thro   the   Turnpike   Road   to   Newbury .   As   nothing suspends   the   faculties   like   astonishment ,   this   great   amazement so   entirely   subdued   my   small   capacity ,   that   I   have   stared without   seeing ,   listening listen'd   without   understanding ,   &   spoke   witht Meaning   ever   since ,   this ,   tho   not   improbable ,   your   Grace   may   be loth   to   believe ;   but   as   arguments   are   best   illustrated   by   an example ,   I   will   give   you   a   very   extraordinary Extraordinary   one ,   &   which will   entirely   convince   you   of   the   truth   of   what   I   advanced . a A   few   days   ago   I   carryed carried   Mrs   Donnellan ,   &   the   little   Pere , to   see   Mr   Sloper's   Gardens   &   House ,   at   a   time   when   I   was assured   he   was   absent   on   his   Election ,   but   seeing   a   Man ride   up   the   Avenue   at   the   same   time ,   I   took   it   into   my head   it   might   be   Mr   Sloper ,   so   I   did   not   alight   immediately . the The   Housekeeper   came   to   me ,   &   ask'd   if   I   wd   walk   in ,   I   said I   should   be   glad   to   see   the   House   if   Mr   Cibber   was   not at   home ,   the   Housekeeper   look'd   as   aghast   as   if   she   had   spoild a   Custard ,   or   broke   a   jelly   glass ;   I   coloured ,   Mrs   Donnellan twitterd ,   Dr   Courayer   sputterd   half   french   half   English ,   &   began to   search   for   ye   Case   of   a   spying   glass   I   had   dropt   in   my   fright . As   my   organs   of   speech ,   rather   than   of   sight ,   seem'd   defective , I   was   little   interested   for   my   perspective ,   but   sat   in   the Coach   making   melancholly   reflections   on   my   mistake . Mrs   Donnellan   could   not   compose   her   countenance ,   so   that we   were   near   a   quarter   of   an   hour   before   we   got   out of   the   Coach   &   after   so   long   a   Pause   I   walk'd   into   the   House greatly Greatly   abash'd .   however ,   in   the   midst   of   my   concern ,   it   gave me   some   Consolation   that   I   could   procure   your   Grace   a   very Salutary   &   happy   fit   of   laughing ,   of   which   I   wish   you   the full   benefit   &   pleasure .   If   I   was   not   afraid   of   fatiguing   you , I   believe   I   could   shake   yr   spleen   with   a   description   of Dr   Courayer's   figure ,   when   he   arrived   here   from   Oxford , thro   a   whole   days   rain ;   but   let   it   suffice   that   he shone   with   drops   of   water   like   the   diamond   ficoides . How   his   beaver   was   slouch'd ,   his   coloured   handkercheif twisted ,   &   his   small   boots   stuck   to   his   small   legs ;   how   the rain   had   wetted uncurled   his   Wig ,   the   spleen   dejected   his   Countenance , the   Cramp   spoild   his   Gait   I   shall can   not   describe ;   having set   you   a   laughing   at   myself ,   it   would   look   like   a   churlish pride ,   or   mauvaise   honte   ,   if   I   should   divert   you   to any   other   subject .   Mrs   Donnellan   &   Dr   Courayer   join   in desiring   their   best   respects   &   compliments   to   yr   Grace   .   I   hope   My   Lord   Duke , and   Mr   Achard ,   will   accept   of   mine ;   &   I   desire   that   when   you are   disposed   to   laugh   at   any   absurdity ,   you   will   not   forget mine ,   who   am   serious ,   &   wise ,   in   nothing   but   being   your   Graces Most   Devoted ,   Sincere , and   affectionate   Humble   Servant E   Montagu "
BC_1747_EMONTAGU_MB_2	  Aug   Madm I   had   a   letter   from   one   of   my   Brothers   at Westminster ,   in   which   he   mentioned   that   Lord   Titchfield   had been   indisposed   but   was   entirely   recoverd ,   &   was   gone   with your   Grace   to   Welbeck ,   I   hoped   his   Lordship   had   only   had a   severe   cold ,   but   on   my   Brothers   coming   here   &   my asking   him   many   questions   I   found   the   Marquiss   had been   worse   than   I   imagined ,   had   I   known   of   his   illness before   I   was   also   informed   of   his   recovery   it   would   have given   me   the   utmost   anxiety :   nor   can   I   without   much pain   reflect   on   what   the   good   &   generous   heart   of   my Dear   friend   has   sufferd .   however ,   not   to   dwell   any   longer on   a   painfull   subject   I   will   give   your   Grace   according to   my   promise   an   account   of   Lady   Fanes   Grotto ,   to begin   with   the   situation ,   it   is   like   most   Grottos   placed where   a   Grotto   would   not   be   look'd   for ;   it   joins   to the   House ;   now   having   told   its   only   defect   I   will go   on   to   the   rest .   the   first   Room   is   fitted   up   entirely   with shells .   the   sides   &   Cieling   in   beautifull   mosaick   a   Rich Cornice   of   Flowers   in   baskets   &   Cornucopias   &   the Little   yellow   sea   snail   is   so   disposed   in   shades   as   to   resemble knots   of   Ribbon   which   seem   to   tye   up   some   of   the bunches   of   flowers .   there   is   a   Bed   for   the   Hermit with which   is   composed   of   fine   shells ,   &   so   shaded   that   the Curtain   seems   folded   &   flowing ,   there   are   many   fine   shells &   I   think   that   this   Room   is   the   prettiest   piece   of   shell work   that   I   have   seen ,   but   the   Room   adjoining   to   it is   in   the   truer   &   proper   stile   of   a   Grotto ,   it   is   composed of   Rough   Rock   work   in   a   very   bold   taste ,   that   it   appears rather   done   by   the   hardy   &   happy   hand   of   nature than   of   finical   art ,   the   water   falls   down   it   into   a Cold   Bath :   this   Grotto   is   about     yards   from   the   Thames to   which   the   descent   is   very   precipitate :   it   wants shade ,   From from   the   Shell   Room   you   have   no   advantage of   the   Thames ,   from   the   other   Room   you   have   a view   of   it .   the   House   which   this   Grotto   is   join'd   to   is a   small   habitation   where   Lady   Fane   used   to   pass a   good   deal   of   time   Lord   Fanes   Seat   is   about   a mile   from   it .   which   indeed   has   not   the   View   of the   Thames   but   is   finely   situated   in   a   Bower of   Beech   wood ,   &   before   it   a   pretty   prospect ;   from the   Grotto   we   went   to   a   Wood   by   the   Thames   where we   sat   &   eat   our   Cold   dinner   very   comfortable comfortably   . in   the   afternoon   we   walked   up   a   Hill   which commands   a   fine   prospect ,   the   Thames   winds   about in   the   manner   it   does   at   Clifden ,   but   as   there you   have   green   meadows   fill'd   with   cattle   you   have here   a   Country   of   Tillage ,   which   I   think   is   not so   refreshing   to   the   Eye ,   as   natures   universal   Livery the   pleasant   Green ;   there   is   also   a   want   of   Wood &   I   think   the   Country   rather   too   flat ,   but   the prospect   is   very   extensive   you   see   Oxford   &   Reading one   on   yr   right   the   other   on   your   left   hand . but   now   having   told   you   our   pleasures   &   amusements I   think   your   Grace   should   lend   a   patient   ear   to our   disasters ,   in   our   Road   thither   one   of   the   Wheels took   fire ,   &   burnt   thro'   the   axletree :   with   much   ado we   reach'd   the   Grotto ,   Amphitrite   was   not   at   home , or   sure surely   she   wd   have   put   us   in   a   large   shell   &   have harnessd   her   Dolphins   &   carried   us   down   the   River , To   Newbury   or   at   least   have   borrowd   Sea   Horses   of   Neptune for   such   as   could   ride :   but   having   none   of   this   Divine Machinery   with   which   Poets   accomodate   Heroes   &   Heroines , or   the   Managers   of   the   Opera   introduce   a new   singer ,   we   were   compell'd   to   implore   the   assistance of   meer   mortals ;   a   Wheelwright   was   apply'd   to , but   he   had   been   carousing   at   a   Christening   & was   not   in   that   degree   of   sober   sense   requisite   to   make Even   an   axle   tree ;   a   justice   of   Peace   whom   the   King in   his   Graciousness   had   knighted   lived   hard   by , to   him   we   apply'd   to   lend   us   a   Coach   to   carry   us home ,   as   it   was   a   part   of   his   office   to   send Vagrants   to   the   Place   of   their   Abode   he   wd not   have   been   so   out   of   character   as   to   have refused   the   Conveyance   if   he   Could   have accomodated   us ,   but   alass   his   Coach   which   contrary to   other   things   used   to   rest   on   the   Week   days   & work   only   on   the   Sabbath ,   had   not   been   licensed to   the   great   inconvenience   of   his   Lady ,   &   the   Grief   of Carter   John ;   who   one   day   in   the   week   was   a Coachman ,   the   Horses   indeed   Brutes   insensible   of Honour   &   dignity   rather   rejoyced   in   the   day   of   rest . What   was   to   be   done   the   sun   was   declining   we were     miles   from   home ,   the   Hermits   bed   was rather   Beautifull   than   soft ,   the   Hill   that   gave us   a   prospect   of   fields   offer'd   us   none   of   a Lodging ,   a   good   Inn   with   the   sign   of   the Blue   Boar ,   Green   Dragon ,   or   Red   Lion   wd   have pleased   us   better   than   all   we   had   seen ;   but   alass ! the   only   Village   within   reach   offerd   us   a   Homely Lodging   under   Thatch'd   Roofs ,   we   were   a   Party of   Seven ,   &   might   have   storm'd   the   Village   with more   ease   than   the   french   can   Bergen   op   zoom , but   the   plunder   wd   not   have   given   us   a   Supper nor   the   place   afforded   us   a   lodging :   but   on   finding the   uncoach'd   justice   was   married   to   Sir   Robt:   Suttons Neice   an   relation acquaintance   of   Mrs   Donnellans   she   sent   her compts   told   our   distress   &   we   were   kindly   received that   night ,   the   Wheelwright   slept   himself   sober the   next   day   made   us   an   axletree   &   we   came Home   laughing   at   our   Adventures   which   we   arrogantly compared   to   those   of   the   Valourous   Quixote ,   or Marvellous   Robinson   Crusoe ,   &   hope   if   Dr   Pocock ( who   was   of   our   Party )   should   add   them   to   his Travels   your   Grace   will   buy   the   new   Eddition for   the   sake   of   so   important ,   interesting ,   &   entertaing an   addition .   Since   I   wrote   this   I   had   yr   Graces which   by   a   mistake   was   sent   to   Marlbro ,   the   Post Master   lays   the   blame   on   the   General   post   office for   my   part   I   know   I   am   very   angry   at   them   all for   delaying   my   pleasure   of   hearing   from   you .

BC_1747_EMONTAGU_MB_3	"Sandleford   ye     of   Septber Madam The   pleasure   your   Graces   letter   gave   me in   confirming   the   good   news   of   Lord   Titchfields   recovery   was more   than   was   consistent   with   that   philosophy   you ascribe   to   me ,   &   which   for   the   sake   of   a   constitution not   very   strong ,   &   a   mind   too   easily   wounded ,   I   wish I   was   more   possess'd   of .   I   am   very   sorry   Lord   Edward   has been   ill ,   nor   is   this   the   first   unphilosophical   concern   I have   felt   for   that   sweet   Babe .   I   am   glad   the   Worm   wood draughts   took   away   his   fever ,   I   believe   they   are   excellent things ,   &   among   my   Neighbours   with   whom   I   practise as   a   Physician   I   think   I   have   done   great   cures with   them .   I   found   your   Graces   letter   at   my   return   from a   tour   we   had   made   as   far   as   Salisbury ;   we   had   the advantage   of   fine   weather   which   contributed   much   to our   pleasure :   as   I   have   not   any   thing   better   to   say   I   think I   may   as   well   give   an   account   of   our   Progress . we   went   from   hence   to   Winchester   where   we   saw   the Cathedral ,   it   is   a   very   neat   Gothick   Building   in   so   good Repair   that   time   seems   rather   to   have   made   it   venerable than   old ;   the   choir   is   very   handsome ;   there   are   many   old Monuments   several   of   the   Saxon   Kings   have   their   bones collected   into   a   sort   of   Trunk ;   so   ancient   has   been   the Custom   even   in   a   rude   nation   to   endeavour   to   extend the   name   beyond   the   period   of   life   &   not   to   let   the   vanity of   man   expire   with   his   Breath :   William   Rufus   is interred   there   too   in   a   kind   of   stone   Chest ;   William of   Wickham   &   Cardinal   Beaufort   bear   their   Ensigns of   ye   Prelatick   order   on   their   Tombs   which   are   very handsome   ones   :   but   let   us   leave   the   pride   of   the   dead for   the   luxury   of   the   living   &   go   on   to   Mr   Dummers which   was   the   next   place   we   went   to   .   the   Gardens are   pretty ,   &   there   is   a   fine   Lawn   before   the   House from   whence   there   is   a   Rich   prospect   &   a   distant sight   of   the   River   at   Southampton .   from   Mr Dummers   we   steerd   our   Course   to   Southampton where   we   arrived   pretty   late   in   the   Evening .   the next   morning   we   surveyd   the   Town ,   which   I   think is   very   pretty   but   what   most   pleased   me   there Was   the   prospect   from   a   little   Round   Tower   from   whence one   has   the   finest   View   imaginable ,   the   Sea   &   River almost   incompass   it ,   &   on   the   opposite   shore   one has   a   Rich   Land   prospect :   upon   the   whole   I   think it   the   gayest   prospect   I   ever   saw .   from   hence   we went   to   Mount   Bevis   your   Grace   knew   it   so   well I   shall   not   describe   it   but   then   you   are   too   well acquainted   with   its   merit   to   think   one   can   pass   it over   in   Silence .   What   a   Noble   Bason   does   the   River form   at   the   End   of   the   Bowling   green !   how   fine   a prospect   from   the   Mount !   Ld   Peterborough   says   in a   letter   to   Mr   Pope   in   reference   to   Mount   Bevis "" I   confess   the   lofty   Sacharissa   at   Stowe   but   am content   with   my   own   little   Amoret ""   his   Lordship had   great   reason   to   be   content ,   for   tho   Stowe   like   a Court   Beauty   is   adorn'd   with   art   &   ornamented   with much   expence ;   the   Native   Graces   of   Mount   Bevis surprize   &   charm   the   beholder   &   have   an   affect   that art   can   never   reach ;   I   was   greatly   delighted   with   this Place   but   your   Grace   saw   it   to   much   agreater   advantage when   the   agreable   Mistress   of   it   was   there :   whose   return I   much   wish'd   while   I   walk'd   under   her   agreable   shades the   Housekeeper   said   she   hoped   her   Ladyship   would return   this   Autumn .   We   spent   a   good   deal   of   time   in these   charming   gardens ,   &   went   from   them   to   Lindhurst one   of   the   Kings   House   in   the   new   forest   which House   the   Duke   of   Bedford   lends   to   Mr   Medows we   staid   some   days   with   them   &   they   carried   us to   see   several   places   first   the   Lodges   in   the   Forest another   day ,   we   dined   at   Hurst   Castle   which   stands on   a   neck   of   Land   that   reaches   within   a   mile of   the   Isle   of   Wight :   of   which   one   has   a   pretty prospect   from   the   Castle   &   on   the   other   hand   the Isle   of   Purbeck   not   far   from   the   Castle   are   the   famous Rocks   called   the   Needles :   we   dined   in   the   Room where   King   Charles   was   for   some   time   detaind   a Prisoner   in   which   situation   I   presume   he   had   little   enjoyment of   the   prospects   but   to   those   who   make   only   a   voluntary   stay Are   all   extreamly   pretty :   but   yr   Grace   is   so   well   acquainted with   them   it   is   unnecessary   to   say   any   thing   particular so   pray   let   us   go   on   to   Ld   Hartfords   at   Marlbrô   where I   will   not   detain   your   imagination   above   a   moment just   to   go   to   a   prodigious   Mount   which   they   say was   raised   by   some   of   the   Saxons   for   a   kind   of   Cittadel here   Lady   Hartford   has   made   a   Grotto   which   is   neither so   rude   as   one   wd   expect   the   works   of   nature   nor so   Elegant   as   one   wd   expect   the   works   of   art .   I   am now   drawing   towards   home   &   will   only   take   a trip   to   Ld   Bruces   in   my   Way :   the   access   to   the   House is   very   Grand ,   large   Avenues   or   Cuts   thro   Woods   with now   &   then   the   opening   of   a   fine   Lawn   leads   You to   the   House ,   the   outside   of   which   promises   little but   as   it   often   happens   contains   more   than   greater outward   appearances   there   are   a   great   number of   good   Rooms   Elegantly   Carved   &   Gilt   several family   pictures   &   handsome   Chimney   peices .   the   Gardens are   too   flat   &   do   not   command   any   prospect . And   upon   the   whole   I   think   the   place   like   the   late Master   rather   Superbe   than   agreable :   I   ask   pardon   for   giving your   Grace   the   fatigue   of   going   so   long   a   journey   with   me , but   I   thought   en   passant   I   might   meet   with   something more   entertaining   for   you   than   at   home ;   the   pleasures   of tranquillity   &   content   are   not   to   be   described ;   this   fine   Summer has   given   one   great   opportunity   of   enjoying   the   pleasures   of the   Country ;   I   have   not   indeed   had   my   health   so   well   as   sometime , My   Stomach   has   been   much   out   of   order ,   for   which   reason I   have   avoided   writing   as   much   as   I   could   for   the   posture does   not   agree   with   me ,   I   am   now   better   &   hope   some   of my   disorder   might   be   owing   to   the   heat   of   the   weather . My   Sister   is   just   gone   from   Tunbridge   to   make   a   short   visit to   Mrs   Best   &   then   I   expect   to   see   her   here ;   it   was   long before   she   found   benefit   by   the   waters   but   they   began to   do   her   service   just   as   she   left   the   place ,   which   she   would not   have   quitted   so   soon   but   out   of   a   desire   to   be   here at   Michaelmass   as   she   promised ;   but   I   am   sorry   she   paid so   much   regard   to   it   upon   this   occasion   for   her   health Wants   great   amendment     he   calld   here in   his   way   thither   &   I   think   he   did   not   look   much   the   worse for   the   fatigue .   Dr   Courayer   &   Mr   Montagu   desire their   best   respects .   I   hope   my   Lord   Duke   &   Mr   Achard will   accept   of   mine I   am Madam Your   Graces   most   Obedt   &   Faithfull Humble   Servant   E   Montagu Yr   Grace   will   see   I   made a   strange   mistake   in   writing on   two   sheets   of   paper   &   I   have   not time   to   write   a   letter   in   properer   form "
BC_1748_EMONTAGU_AD_1	ye   Dear   Madam It   is   long   since   I   have   given   my   self the   pleasure   of   Writing   to   you ,   we   Invalids   think   more of   how   we   do   than   of   what   we   do ;   I   am   now   endeavouring to   gain   a   stock   of   health ,   &   like   those   we   call   provident neglect   present   pleasure   for   the   hopes   of   future .   I   think I   may   now   say   I   am   really   better   than   when   I   came ,   & that   I   seem   in   a   way   to   recover   health ,   but   do   not   as   yet enjoy   it   in   any   perfect   degree .   I   am   still   undetermined as   to   the   time   of   staying   here ,   for   tho   my   Inclination points   strongly   towards   London   I   must   wave   all consideration   for   that   necessary   ingredient   to   all happiness   call'd   health ,   &   must   be   content   with   gaining that   one   point   as   it   is   so   Essential   an   one .   I   suppose I   shall   Come   to   Town   just   when   Old   fashion   people   used to   leave   it   to   gather   Cowslips   in   the   Country .   I   am   not surprized   at   what   you   say   of   a   certain   Persons   gayety &   spirits   Constitution   does   for   them   more   than   Religion &   philosophy   can   do   for   others ;   this   happy   insensibility   to   be   envy'd ,   this   Person   has   made   a   Paradise of   the   World   &   has   thro'   life   gathered   the   Sweet   without feeling   the   thorn .   how   blest   a   Condition   to   enter   into   the joys   of   all   relations   without   feeling   a   pang   at   their dissolution !   Mr   Montagu   was   in   great   pain   to   know how   they   would   bear   the   shock ,   I   answerd   the   better   for not   feeling   it .   but   this   between   ourselves   only .   When   I   wrote   last to   you   I   was   in   wretched   spirits ,   I   am   now   better   in   that respect   as   well   as   others .   I   have   moved   my   lodging to   Orange   Court   &   have   got   a   very   pleasant   habitation a   prospect   of   the   Hills ,   a   village ,   &   the   River   which last   murmurs   very   agreably   and   makes   me   forget I   am   not   in   the   Country   which   I   could   always   wish for   part   of   the   day .   We   have   still   a   good   deal   of Company   Lady   Bateman   Lady   Albemarle   Lady   Huntingdon Lady   Lucy   &   Lady   Jane   Stanhope ,   Mrs   Pitt   your   Spa Acquaintance   Lady   Portland   Lady   B:   Egerton   Lady   Sophia Grey .   as   to   the   Dutchess   of   Kent   she   does   not   come   out so   can   hardly   be   reckond   one   of   the   Company As   to   fine   Men   they   are   scarce ,   the   Duke   of   Bolton   is here   with   Mrs   Beswick   &   all   his   Illegitimate   Issue . The   Coffee   House   is   really   grown   sprightly .   We   meet Mrs   Pit   Mrs   G:   Trevor   Lady   Lucy   Stanhope   &   a   few more   &   we   are   often   very   merry   &   sit   round   the fire   after   other   people   go   away .   Mrs   Pitt   is   really very   sensible   &   agreable .   I   believe   I   told   you   Mrs Freind   had   innoculated   her   Son ,   he   is   now   quite   Well   but   this   formidable   distemper   has   kept   us   from   the agreable   Society .   Mr   Freind   I   hear   went   to   Town   this week ,   I   dare   say   in   great   spirits   to   think   of   the   happy   way he   left   his   Son   in ,   just   recovering   from   a   distemper   the very   fear   of   which   enslaves   people   all   their   lives . Mrs   Knight   is   here   &   designs   to   stay   till   April   &   then returns   again   to   Bristol .   I   am   sorry   to   hear   Miss   Chudleigh is   so   ill   again .   I   thought   she   lookd   well   when   she   went from   Bath .   Mr   Montagu   &   my   Sister   desire   their   complimts Miss   Grinfeild Grisfeild   desires   her   humble   Service   with   great   respect . My   Complimts   attend   Mr   &   Mrs   Percival   &   ye   good   little   Pere I   am   Dear   Madm   /   Yours   most   sincerely   /   E   Montagu 
BC_1748_EMONTAGU_AD_2	Cambridge     of   june Dear   Madm As   I   date   my   letter   from   the   modern Capitol   of   the   Muses   you   will   perhaps   expect   that I   should   send   you   some   strains   of   Immortal   Poetry , but   I   have   not   yet   met   with   any   such   thing ; &   must   rather   give   an   account   of   the   Buildings   than the   literary   Works   of   the   University .   I   had   some   pleasure in   the   recollection   of   the   easy   careless   years   of   Infancy , some   part   of   which   I   pass'd   here   with   with   the   most tender   of   Relations   ever   a   fond   Grandmother ;   in   comparison of   whose   indulgence   all   other   indulgence   is   severity , as   you   must   be   sensible   if   ever   you   had   the greatest   of   infant   comforts   a   Grandmother .   So   much for   my   particular   circumstances ,   then   to   the   general Situation   of   the   University .   the   Colleges   do   not in   general   stand   so   as   to   give   ornament   to   the Town   as   those   at   Oxford ,   but   if   the   Town   is   the worse   for   it   the   Colleges   are   the   better ,   as   they open   to   the   fields   &   from   thence   receive   &   give   a   fine   prospect Kings   College ,   Clare   Hall ,   &   Trinity   Library ,   &   the   finest of   Gothick   Buildings   Kings   College   Chapel   make A   beautifull   appearance   from   the   Publick   Walks : Trinity   College   is   a   most   Noble   thing ,   the   quadrangle is   a   sixth   part   bigger   than   that   of   Christs   church in   Oxford .   the   Library   is   a   very   handsome   &   esteem'd   one of   the   finest   Rooms   in   the   World ,   in   the   Library   there   is preserved   the   Skeleton   of   a   Gentleman   who   left   his bones   as   a   monument   of   his   Regard   to   Mankind   on purpose   to   instruct   even   the   most   superficial   observer in   the   formation   of   the   Human   body   &   at   the   same time   design'd   that   his   name   like   his   body   might be   snatch'd   from   the   Grave ;   how   various   are   the Roads   to   Fame !   some   seek   them   by   Grand   &   pompous Obsequies ,   others   expect   them   for   not   having   Christian burial ,   and   prefer   to   be   rememberd   by   a   Magnificent Tomb   or   the   Want   of   a   Coffin .   I   always   thought   Vanity the   very   marrow   of   a   Human   Creature   &   behold   it   sticks to     ye   bones .   I   have   been   greatly   amused   here   by seeing   ye   fine   buildings   but   what   gives   me   the   greatest pleasure   is   the   seeing   Dr   Middleton   married   to   a Person   who   seems   formed   to   make   him   happy   she is   very   well   bred   &   agreable   has   a   most   obliging   temper likes   his   manner   of   Life   shows   him   the   greatest regard ,   &   among   her   accomplishmts   I   must   take Notice   of   her   playing   on   the   Harpsicord ,   which   the Judges   say   she   does   in   great   perfection .   I   found   my   two Brothers   very   well   &   extreamly   happy   in   their   situation I   had   letters   yesterday   from   London   by   which   I   find that   Master   Knight   has   got   the   small   pox ,   so   I cannot   return   to   Golden   Square ,   &   should   therefore be   infinitely   obliged   to   you   if   you   could   lend   me   a feather   bed   Blankets   &   Bolster   &   I   have   orderd the   two   pair   of   stairs   Rooms   in   Hillstreet   which   were   paperd at   Michaelmass   to   be   aired   for   me   to   lodge   in   few   days   I   shall   stay   in   Town :   for   you   know   I   have invincible   objections   to   Lodgings ,   &   I   think   that   apartment must   be   dry ,   as   it   was   finish'd   so   long   ago :   but   my featherbeds   not   having   been   used   I   feard   they   would require   a   long   time   to   dry .   I   propose   to   be   in   Town   on Monday .   for   as   matters   have   fallen   out   I   must   give a   little   time   for   ye   preparation   of   our   House .   &   I   hope you   will   excuse   my   troubling   you   for   a   Bed   but   I will   take   care   it   shall   not   receive   any   damage . Mr   Montagu   desires   his   compliments ,   our   Youths add   theirs ,   my   best   respects   attend   Mrs   Percival   & say   something   very   soft   &   tender   for   me   to   the   little   Pere . I   wish   you   much   pleasure   with   the   nightingales of   Northend ,   &   you   have   a   good   right   to   be   of   so harmonious   a   Society .   I   am   ever Dr   Madam   Your   sincerely affect:   E.   Montagu 
BC_1748_EMONTAGU_SS	ye     June   My   Dear   Sally I   am   return'd   from   dining   with   my honoured   Father .   he   was   dress'd   very   beauish   &   fine   to make   his   appearance   at   Ranelagh .   We   have   been   very busy   in   getting   things   here   in   order   for   next   winter , as   to   the   furniture   it   cannot   be   put   up   in   the middle   floor   on   account   of   the   Floors   not   being   laid &   the   last   painting   not   being   done ,   but   as   things will   be   ready   to   put   into   ye   House   when   we   come to   Town   a   short   time   will   finish .   your   apartment ( which   in   your   absence   we We   have   presumed   to   inhabit ) is   really   very   pleasant .   Dettemere   will   get   your things   as   soon   as   she   is   able ,   but   she   is   still   extreamly ill ,   the   day   I   came   to   Town   she   had   such   a   violent convulsive   Hiccup   after   every   thing   she   eat   or drank   that   I   fear'd   she   wd   be   choaked ,   &   fainting &   Hysterick   fits   have   not   been   wanting .   it   is a   Melancholly   affair   that   she   may   now   be   persecuted with   Duns   &   I   know   not   what .   she   loved her   Husband   extreamly   but   as   they   had   not been   together   of   so   long   a   time   I   hope   she   will not   feel   the   loss   so   severely   after   the   first   shock is   over .   her   friends   had   foolishly   concealed Mr   Dettemeres   death   from   her   so   that   she knew   nothing   of   it   till   she   had   her   Daughters letter   which   I   assure   you   was   very   kind   & generous   &   the   poor   Girl   has   really   some   excellt qualities :   her   Mother   will   write   to   her   as   soon as   she   can   command   herself   so   as   not   to   write too   melancholly :   she   is   mightily   pleased   with   ye   letters Betty   has   wrote   her .   I   have   not   yet   had   time   to   see Miss   Grinfield   but   I   hear   she   is   much   liked at   Court   both   by   the   Princesses   &   ye   Attendants I   was   with   her   one   Evening   before   I   left   Town , her   Room   is   small   but   looks   very   prettily   on ye   Park   &   I   hope   she   will   live   comfortably . I   attempted   to   see   Cotes   but   she   was   not   at   home but   I   am   to   go   to   her   tomorrow . I   shall   go   out of   Town   on   Thursday ,   to   my   great   &   inexpressible joy .   I   tell   you   as   a   secret   that   I   have   consulted Dr   Shaw   being   not   a   little   discontent   at   ye last   return   of   my   disorder ,   he   says   my   liver ails ,   nothing   but   all   my   complaints   arise   from a   sharp   scorbutick   disorder   &   he   is   to   put   me in   a   method   for   it :   he   talks   very   reasonably &   tho   he   proposes   a   disagreable   method   I   shall submit   to   it ;   he   does   not   order   blistering   &   bleeding but   I   am   to   be   sweated   but   keep   this   a   secret for   I   wd   not   mention   it   to   my   Father .   nor   wd I   have   the   Doctors   at   Bath   informed   of   it . I   have   several   heats   come   out   on   me   &   he is   to   procure   me   a   good   rash   if   he   can ,   &   then   he assures   me   I   shall   neither   be   sick   nor   nervous . after   my   sweating   fit   is   over   I   am   to   drink   asses Milk   ride   on   Horseback   &   grow   fat   &   jolly .   I   am now   thinner   than   ever   so   the   reformation   will be   great   if   I   grow   fat .   My   Brother   Morris   was   here   last night ,   he   looks   very   well .   My   Brother   Robinson   had a   very   pleasant   journey   to   Aix .   Where   I   dare   say   he will   have   a   great   deal   of   pleasure .   there   will   be a   great   concourse   of   people   of   all   Nations   &   Lord   & Lady   Sandwich   are   extreamly   obliging   to   him   & by   their   means   he   may   be   introduced   into ye   best   company .   I   perswaded   him   much   to   go   &   hope it   will   be   very   agreable     Mr   Flower   sent   yr   pumps yesterday   I   did   not   pay   for   them   on   acct   of   his   raising   ye price .

BC_1749_EMONTAGU_LB	Hillstreet ye       nov. ? Madam I   had   the   pleasure   of   receiving   your   Graces letter   here   which   was   intended   for   me   at   Sandleford .   Tho   it   is usually   observed   that   people   are   most   desirious   of   receiving   letters in   the   Country ,   I   did   not   find   the   pleasure   your   Graces   letters always   give   me   was   at   all   diminish'd   by   receiving   it   in   this great   Citty .   for   the   most   numerous   Societies   are   almost   a   Solitude if   one   seeks   a   friend   of   the   character   of   the   Dutchess   of   Chandos there   are   but   few   who   pay   that   tribute   to   virtue   of   even endeavoring   to   appear   what   she   really   is .   I   found   the   Town   in a   great   bustle   about   the   Westminster   Election ,   the   Popular   affections were   strong   for   Sir   George ,   much   wit   was   lavish'd   on   the   occasion , the   French   Comedy   was   supported   by   Ld   T-   to   the   great   offence   of   the Common   people ,   his   neglecting   to   present   a   Petition   for   Penlez   when desired   it   by   his   constituents   was   another   Grievance ,   &   the   Ghost of   Penlez   was   carried   about   the   Town   in   procession .   all   things seemd   to   promise   success   for   Sir   G:   till   the   Court   party   began to   rouse   themselves   &   at   a   very   great   expence   &   other   Election arts   got   a   Majority   on   the   Poll .   A   scrutiny   is   demanded but   what   success   it   will   have   is   uncertain ,   the   Inhabitants of   Whitehall   the   Admiralty   & c   who   do   not   pay   rates   have poll'd   contrary   to   custom .   the   D-   of   B-   did   not   find   his   interest in   Covent   Garden   so   strong   as   was   imagined ,   most   of   his   Tenants voted   for   Sir   G- .   The   scrutiny   is   to   begin   the   end   of   this   month   . This   public   affair   &   the   Cause   of   Lady   Mary   C-he   has   well   supply   the   Town   with   discourse ;   the   Men   are   all   on   the   side   of   the Lady   but   the   unmarried   Ladies   who   would   give   the   World   a   good opinion   of   their   patience   &   meekness   are   of   the   Husbands   Party the   most   usual   opinion   &   that   which   people   are   most   ready   to declare   is   that   they there   are   faults   on   both   sides ,   the   trial   is   to come   on   next   Term   in   the   mean   time   the   poor   Lady lies   sick   in   a   Wretched   Room   in   Ld   L-s   House   where   or     persons   are   permitted   to   visit   her .   heads   of   accusation of   Cruelty   are   to   appear   against   the   gentleman   instances of   perverseness   &   obstinacy   against   the   Lady   &   how   the   account will   be   balanced   is   not   certain ,   but   as   the   Laws   are   in favor   of   the   Men   it   is   said   she   will   be   sentenced   to   be return   to   her   Husband ,   at   present   Ld   Burlington   &   some others   give   Bail   for   his   keeping   the   Peace .   she   is   in   a   terrible state   of   health   &   has   hopes   of   that   great   Deliverer   &   final punisher   of   all   Human   Woes .   an   infallible   medicine   but   an untimely   cure   at   .   When   she   appeard   in   Court   she   lookd   so ill   that   her   Sister   Lady   Stratford   who   had   not   seen   her   since her   going   into   ye   Country ,   fell   into   Convulsions   when   she appeard ,   &   Lady   Mary   fainted   away ,   the   Lawyers   tho   not of   the   melting   mood   almost   wept ,   but   Ld   L-   &   Ld   C   shewd themselves   superior   to   such   weakness   &   stood   unmoved Ld   C   waited   on   Lady   Mary   to   her   Chair   &   desired   her   to take   care   she   did   not   catch   cold   as   her   Chair   glass was   broken ,   at   which   the   Mob   cry d   out   very   scornfully Tender   hearted   Creature !   &   it   was   well   he   got   off   without   more visible   marks   of   their   dislike   for   they   were   much enraged   .   A   parting   has   been   much   wishd   by   the   Ladies Ladys rends   but   Ld   C-   says   he   is   so   much   in   love   with her   he   cannot   consent   to   a   separation .   it   seems   Ld   L is   desirous   his   Son   should   perpetuate   his   family . The   Opera's   are   worse   than   ever ,   the   Syrens   that   sing   there   cannot draw   any   company .   As   to   Cards   they   flourish   much ,   but   the French   ambassadress   exceeds   all   our   Ladies   for   high   play . &   I   am   glad   our   Country   women   are   willing   to   give   her   that Preheminence   ;   she   loses   sometimes   three   or   four   hundred   pound a   night   &   sometimes   wins   more ,   she   plays   very   well .   Mr Mirepoise   excells   at   all   games   of   skill .   Lord   Chesterfield   is usually   of   Madme   Mirepoise   party   at   piquet .   The   Town   is not   by   any   means   full ,   &   many   people   are   going   into   ye Country   for   the   Hollidays .   We   propose   to   be   at   Sandleford   on Saturday ,   from   whence   I   shall   soon   make   a   visit   to   Shaw . The   Lady   Seymours   cannot   get   the   Lawyers   yet   to   finish   their settlements :   they   keep   all   their   fortunes   in   their   own   power but   ten   thousand   pounds .   it   is   said   pretty   Miss   Carpenter   is to   be   married   to   Sir   Geo:   Savile ,   he   has   a   very   goody   character &   a   very   large   Estate   two   good   ingredients   in   a   match . I   do   not   hear   of   any   new   books   or   pamphlets   that   are   worth reading .   Miss   Anstey   &   Mr   Montagu   desire   your   Graces   acceptance of   their   compliments .   May   all   health   &   happiness   attend   your Grace   in   this   &   every   other   Season . I   am   Madam Your   Graces   most   Obedt most   Obliged   &   Devoted Hon   Servant   E Montagu 
BC_1749_EMONTAGU_SS	Hillstreet Saturday   ye     feb My   Dear   Sister I   should   have   wrote   to   you   sooner   if   Mr Montagu's   indisposition   had   not   prevented   me ,   thank God   he   is   well   again ,   but   has   had   a   grievous cough ;   he   had   two   fits   of   Coughing   in   which   he   would   have   fallen   off   his   chair   if I   had   not   caught   him ,   but   a   large   blister   carried off   his   cough ,   &   he   had   not   any   fever   or   other complaint   attending   him ,   but   really   there   could not   be   any   thing   more   alarming   than   those terrible   fits   of   Coughing .   he   had   a   cold   when   I   receivd your   letter   but   as   he   seem'd   not   at   all   affected   with by it   in   Spirits ,   sleep ,   or   appetite ,   I   was   not   at   all apprehensive   till   those     fits .   I   did   not   imagine you   had   heard   of   his   illness   or   I   wd   have   wrote an   immediate   acct   of   his   being   better ,   for   I   know you   wd   be   concernd   both   for   him ,   &   me .   Indeed the   last   fit   frighten'd   me   so   much   that   I had   an   Hysteric   fit   which   I   had   not   had   of   a year   &   half ,   &   have   not   been   very   well   since I   was   a   little   feverish   for   some   days ,   but   that   is gone   off ,   &   I   had   but   one   sick   fit   which   I   think as   my   stomach   has   never   been   quite   well is   being   as   cheap   off   as   I   could   hope ,   after   so great   a   fright .   Mr   Montagu   goes   out   to   take the   air   every   day   &   if   the   weather   was   not so   rainy   wd   go   out   as   usual ,   but   I   think it   is   better   for   him   not   to   venture   abroad too   soon ,   &   he   has   always   some   Company at   home   every   day .   Mrs   Cotes   was   so   good   as to   come   while   he   had   his   blister ;   I   had   something to   do   to   get   him   to   try   such   a   troublesome remedy ,   but   as   it   has   been   so   successfull ,   I hope   that   shd   he   have   another   cough   as bad ,   he   wd   more   readily   submit   to   it .   he was   blooded   after   ye   first   fit ,   but   not   with   so good   success   as   the   blister .   Mrs   Knight   dined with   us   the   beginning   of   this   week ,   she   is very   happy   in   her   situation   at   Kensington . I   am   told   that   Lady   Bab   wrote   to   Betty   Pitt to   enquire   when   she   design'd   leaving   her place ,   the   poor   Creature   has   been   so   ill   she could   not   write ,   Dr   Hebberden   &   Mr   Hemet the   toothdrawer   have   attended   her   one   applyd To   her   Constitution   the   other   to   her   Gums . She   has   had   such   a   swelld   face   that   she   cd   not see   out   of   her   Eyes   &   has   been   in   exquisite pain ,   one   tooth   was   drawn   to   day   &   she is   something   better ,   so   will   be   able   to   answer Lady   Babs   letter .   but   I   would   desire   you   to tell   her   Ladyship   if   she   has   any   view   of   getting her   a   good   place   I   shd   be   extreamly   glad of   it ,   for   I   think   the   Stoves   hurt   her   health , &   on   that   acct   offerd   her   an   addition   to her   Wages   if   she   got   another   place   in order   to   assist   her   Child   at   Nurse ,   but   she was   not   willing   to   go .   I   could   not   make her   upper   Housemaid   for   tho   she   is   a   good Creature   &   means   well ,   she   is   so   careless in   matter   of   Cleanliness ,   &   so   apt   to   break things ,   I   shd   have   had   my   best   furniture spoild   if   it   had   been   under   her   management . I   beg   if   Lady   Bab   can   get   her   a   good   place she   will   let   me   know   it ,   for   I   wd   not   on any   account   hinder   her   &   wd   still   contribute to   the   keeping   her   boy ,   &   it   could   not   be   any   manner of   inconvenience   to   me   to   part   with   her . I   think   with   much   pleasure   of   our   approaching meeting ,   &   shall   prepare   to   go   out   of   Town   with great   alacrity   as   soon   as   the   time   approaches . I   was   not   under   any   apprehension   abt the   Earthquake ,   but   went   that   night   to the   Oratorio ,   then   quietly   to   bed ;   but   the Madness   of   the   Multitudes   was   prodigious , near     of   the   people   I   had   sent   to   to   play at   Cards   here ,   ye   Saturday   following   went out   of   Town   to   avoid   being   swallow'd ,   &   I believe   they   made   a   third   part   of   the   number I   ask'd ,   so   that   you   may   imagine   how universal   the   fright   must   be ;   the   Wednesday night   the   Oratorio   was   very   empty ,   tho   it was   the   most   favorite   performance   of   Handels . My   Brother   Willy   according   to   his   laudable custom   is   gone   to   the   Play ,   I   exhort   him   to take   his   fill   of   prophane   delights   before   he puts   on   his   Canonicals ,   he   looks   very   handsome &   is   in   good   spirits .   Morris   &   the   Captain   are both   out   of   Town ;   the   Capt:   has   been   at   Newmarket Races .   Mrs   Bothams   newborn   Son   has   had   two Convulsion   fits   so   that   I   fear   he   may   not   live If   he   does   he   will   be   a   pious   Christian   as   I   have taken   upon   myself   to   instruct   him .   I   suppose   Mrs Delany   may   be   at   Bath   by   this   time   pray   make my   Compts   to   her   when   you   see   her .   Mrs   Yorke   is gone   into   the   Country   again ,   she   was   very   happy in   Whisk   &   agreable   people   while   she   Staid .   You will   wonder   to   hear   I   play   at   Brag ,   but   it   is   a game   so   adapted   to   my   capacity   I   cannot   resist it .   To   say   ye   truth   I   have   not   playd   very   often   but just   enough   to   give   myself   the   air   of   a   Card   player . Mr   Montagu   desires   his   complimts   to   you   &   Lady Bab ,   I   desire   mine   to   her   Ladyship .   I   shall   wish for   the   Month   of   May ,   &   be   willing   to   allow   it   all the   merit   the   Poets   give   it   when   it   brings   me the   pleasure   of   seeing   you .   Pray   let   me   have   yr issions   if   you   want   any   thing   before   I   leave Town .   I   am   Dear   Sister   yours   most   affectionately E   Montagu 
BC_1750_EMONTAGU_LB_1	  Mar.     / Madam I   am   infinitely   obliged   to   your   Grace   for   enquiring after   me   in   this   time   of   fright   &   Consternation .   Many people   have   left   &   are   still   leaving   London   for   which   I   cannot blame   them   as   the   Earthquakes   have   been   most   terrible   in this   part   of   the   World   &   I   will   agree   with   your   Grace   that for   Sin   &   Sulphur   this   Town   is   indeed   a   perfect   Pandemonium . but   as   the   change   of   Climate   has   been   very   remarkable every   where   I   imagine   it   by   no   means   certain   that   other parts   of   England   may   not   feel   this   distemper   of   the   Earth . We   cannot   certainly   make   any   Estimation   of   the   degree of   danger   that   attends   these   shocks .   the   powers   of nature   are   so   little   understood   by   it us   ;   as   for   those   who fly   from   hence   under   the   apprehension   of   an   impending judgment   of   the   Town   I   think   them   the   least   reasonable as   we   may   be   sure   that   any   immediate   punishment   from   the Divine   Being   is   but   a   distant   mercy ;   his   exercise   of power   being   always   to   end   in   good ;   the   Clergy   take   this the opportunity   of   this   Panic   to   denounce   Divine   Vengeance if   it   may   lend   in   the   reformation   of   peoples   lives   it   will have   a   happy   effect ,   but   I   fear   it   will   be   of   very   short influence ,   for   there   wants   not   Earthquakes   to   threaten   to   swallow Human   Creatures   when   we   all   know   the   Grave   must in   a   few   years   open   to   receive   us .   I   suppose   your   Grace has   had   many   accounts   of   the   Earthquakes   &   I   will give   you   mine   that   you   may   compare   with   what others   say   they   heard   or   felt .     At   the   first   I   was   in   my Dressing   Room   writing   my   accounts   at   a   Desk   when   I was   alarmed   with   a   violent   noise   as   if   a   Cart   of Horses   had   been   overturn'd   into   the   Room   under   me &   then   the   Room   shook   very   much .   I   thought   the   House falling   &   calld   the   Serts   who   said   the   Vaults   were falling   in ,   on   which   thinking   my   self   not   considerable enough   for   so   large   a   Monument   I   bad   a Sert   call   my   Chairmen   &   another   to   go   to   our   the   instant   they   opend   the   Hall   Door   they   saw   great Consternation   in   the   Street   &   the   People   our   Houses seem d   to   nod   at   them ,   my   Chairmen   were   in   a Street   just   by   &   the   same   appeard   there   so   then convinced   it   was   a   universal   danger   I   returnd   to my   Chamber .   Tho   we   seem d   to   shake   so   much   none of   my   china   fell   down   but   in   the   House   keepers Room   where   china   &   Dessert   glasses   were   very   near each   other   they   jingled   extreamly .   The   last   Earthquake was   Dreadfull ;   at   first   there   was   a   noise   equal to   the   report   of   a   Cannon   which   awakend   one   & then   the   Ground   seem d   to   rise   then   to   seek   &   afterwards succeeded   the   Horistontal   shaking   which   was so   violent   one   wonderd   it   did   not   shake   down   the Houses .   the   Sashes   Clatter'd   the   china   on   the   chimney peices   rang   &   ones   bed   seemd   to   roll ,   it   was   short   but terrible .   I   must   own   I   was   rejoyced   when   it   was   over . the   first   Earthquake   was   not   felt   by   those   who   were Not   in   Houses   but   this   seem d   terrible   to   the   Centiads in   the   Park   &   to   all   who   were   abroad .   the   utmost extent   of   this   has   been   about     miles   &   most Violent   on   one   side   the   River .   the   Spring   tides were   never   known   so   high ,   &   the   lights   in   the sky   were   very   remarkable   about   a   week   before each   Earthquake .   Dr   Monroe   says   he   say saw   a   ball   of fire   as   he   was   walking   in   his   Garden   during   the time   of   the   Earthquake .   Lord   Winchelsea   says   that there   was   an   Earthquake   at   his   House   at   Eastwell in   Kent   this   day   Sennight ,   I   can   hardly   give   faith to   it   as   his   House   is   still   standing   for   I   have   long thought   if   one   of   the   Rats   in   it   had   taken   a   jump it   might   have   endangerd   the   Edifice .   I   am   very   glad Lord   Canarvon   has   succeeded   to   his   wishes ,   your   Graces   zeal for   every   thing   that   relates   to   him   is   suitable   to   the   goodness of   your   general   disposition   which   must   be   still   warmd by   his   near   relation   to   his   Excellent   Grandfather .   Mr Montagu   is   just   come   from   the   House   he   begs   his compts   to   yr   Grace ,   he   has   brought   home   company who   expect   me   to   carve   their   dinner   or   I   should   not so   soon   put   an   End   to   my   letter I   am Madam Your   Graces Most   Obliged And   most   faithfull Humble   Sert E   Montagu tuesday   ten   o'clock . 
BC_1750_EMONTAGU_LB_2	ca.     Oct. Sandleford   wednesday   morn It   is   with   great   pleasure   that   I   find   myself many   miles   nearer   my   Dear   Lady   Dutchess   than   I   was   a   few   days ago ,   &   I   hoped   before   this   time   to   have   enjoy'd   the   benefit   of being   so   little   distant   from   Shaw ,   but   the   severity   of   the   weather has   every   day   disappointed   my   hopes   of   waiting   on   your Grace ;   So   I   will   no   longer   defer   sending   to   enquire   after   your   health , &   hope   the   weather   will   soon   be   so   moderate   as   to   permit me   to   be   an   Eye   witness   of   it .   I   was   so   ill   at   first   going   to Tunbridge   that   I   was   obliged   to   stay   long   there   to   establish my   health ,   a   remarkably   thin   Season   &   the   late   time   of   the year   made   the   Place   hardly   to   be   called   a   Public   one ;   but health   my   object ,   &   the   weather   favorable   for   the   waters , I   staid   with   great   patience ,   &   came   away   much   better of   my   complaints   tho   they   are   not   absolutely   removed .   We spent   above   three   weeks   in   London   which   was   as   empty   as ever   I   saw   it ,   the   Dowager   Lady   Stratford   kept   up   the   spirit of   Assemblies   thro   the   whole   year ,   but   except   at   her   House I   did   not   hear   of   any   large   meetings ,   I   cannot   call   those Societys   where   cards   are   the   imployment .   The   mercers have   exhausted   their   invention   for   fine   Stuffs   for   the   Birthday &   the   Ladies   will   exhaust   their   purses   to   purchase   them . There   was   little   news   stirring ,   the   Duke   of   Ancasters   marriage with   Miss   Panton   is   said   to   be   settled .   &   Mr   Bathurst   son to   Lady   Selena ,   is   going   to   enter   the   holy   state   with Miss   Evelyn .   happy   if   the   seriousness   &   gravity   of   the   engagem can   counterpoise   the   levity   of   his   genius ! I   hope   we   are   to   remain   here   till   after   Xmass   for   the   Parliament it   is   imagined   will   not   meet   before   january ,   I   am   very   glad of   so   long   retirement   &   repose   after   my   Summers   Rambles ; too   much   dissipation   is   not   agreable ;   &   one   is ,   &   ought   to   be   glad , sometimes   to   commune   with   ones   own   heart   in   ones   chamber &   be   still .   your   Grace   knows   how   to   employ   your   time   in   retiremt which   is   of   all   others   the   most   usefull   Science ,   &   gives   the best   sort   of   independance ;   the   independance   of   the   mind :   While others   are   forced   to   beg   in   Cities   their   daily   amusement   a Servitude   equal   perhaps   to   that   of   begging   ones   bread ,   but   as the   Slave   of   pleasure   is   better   drest   &   accommodated   than   the Slave   of   poverty   he   meets   with   less   pitty   &   contempt . I   hope   very   soon   to   tell   your   Grace   de   vive   voix   how   much &   with   what   respect I   am Madam Your   Graces most   Obliged And   most   faithfull Humble   Servant E   Montagu Mr   Montagu   begs   your   Grace to   accept   of   his   compliments 
BC_1750_EMONTAGU_SS_1	Wednesday   ye     of   Jan   Sandleford Dear   Sister I   am   afraid   you   have   thought   me   a   very   negligent Correspondent ,   but   really   the   hurry   of   London   is   intolerable   when   one goes   for   a   short   time ,   &   since   I   came   down   I   have   been   a   great deal   engaged .   Lady   Sandwich   was   so   good   as   to   spend   a   week   with us ,   &   as   the   weather   was   fine   for   this   time   of   year ,   we went   out   in   the   Post   Chaise   all   the   morning ;   then   dinner , tea ,   &   supper   pretty   well   filld   the   rest   of   the   time .   On   Monday night   the   next   morning   she   went   to   Town   &   I   return'd   hither where   I   found   my   Brothers ,   who   give   me   a   very   agreable   account of   your   health ,   &   I   hope   you   will   go   on   thriving   till   you   are as   robust   as   possible ,   for   even   in   this   age   of   delicacy   one does   not   wish   for   delicacy   of   Constitution ,   &   yet   I   fear   in   our Sex   it   is   too   apt   to   attend   that   of   the   mind .   Providence did   not   seem   to   design   Women   for   thinking   beings ,   &   those amongst   them   who   are   so   usually   pay   a   severe   fine   for   it : that   sort   who   Shakespear   says ,   are   fit   to   suckle   fools ,   & chronicle   Small   beer ,   have   the   best   health .   I   saw   our   friend Cotes   the   day   before   I   left   Town ,   she   is   very   well   &   in   good   spirits &   seems   determined   to   keep   her   freedom   &   enter   no   more   into Wedlocks   bonds ,   but   I   cannot   admire   her   way   of   living :   she has   only   a   Small   lodging ,   &   I   think   with   her   œconomy   she might   afford   herself   a   House   of   her   own ,   which   wd   be   more comfortable   than   the   Society   of   a   Landlady   &   she   might   furnish it   in   the   present   fashion   of   some   cheap   paper ,   &   ornaments   of Chelsea   China   or   the   Manufacture   of   Bow ,   which   makes   a Room   look   neat   &   finish'd ,   tho   they   are   not   so   sumptuous As   mighty   Pagods   of   China ,   or   Nodding   Mandarines .   My   dressing Room   in   London   is   like   the   Temple   of   some   Indian   God ,   if I   was   Remarkably   short ,   &   had   a   Great   head ,   I   should   be   afraid People   wd   think   I   meant   my   self   Divine :   Honors ,   but   I can   so   little   pretend   to   the   embonpoint   of   a   josse   it   is impossible   to   suspect   me   of   such   presumption .   The   very   Curtains are   chinese   Pictures   on   Gause ,   &   the   chairs   like   indian   far   shêks with   Cushions   of   Japan   Sattin   painted .   as   to   the   beauty   of Coloring   it   is   carried   as   high   as   possible ,   but   the   Toillette   you was   so   good   as   to   paint   is   the   only   thing   where   Nature triumphs ,   I   shall   be   very   glad   whenever   you   are   disposed   to visit   this   Gaudy   Temple ,   &   you   will   see   with   some   Conscious   pride how   light   &   Shade   mix   well   in   painting ,   &   how   it   exceeds   those performances   where   blue   red   &   green ,   make   all   the   merit . Lady   Sandwich   brought   her   Sons   here ,   they   are   charming   boys , Lord   Hinchingbroke   is   much   improved   since   you   saw   him , Master   Montagu   is   a   compleat   beauty .   We   propose   to   stay here   till   the     &   hope   to   keep   the   Captain   with   us . Dr   Anstey   was   in   a   great   hurry   to   have   his   Daughter back ,   but   I   wd   not   part   with   her   till   I   came   down ,   she   went the   day   before   me .   tho   I   had   written   most   suppliant   letters to   the   Dr ,   but   what   Interest   can   any   Woman   hope   for   in a   Man   whom   time   has   hardend   for   fourscore   years   past ? she   had   a   bad   journey   down ,   &   has   got   a   great   cold . Charles   left   us   two   days   before   Miss   Anstey ,   &   went   to   his Studies   at   Cambridge .   Mrs   Southwell   has   miscarried   but   is as   well   as   could   be   hoped   upon   such   an   occasion . My   Brothers   tell   me   Mrs   Friend   is   very   ill ,   but   I   hope   not   more than   usuall   in   her   lying   in ,   when   I   think   she   always   suffers a   great   deal .   Mr   Morgan   is   at   last   deprived   of   the   Curacy of   Newtown .   which   is   a   great   grief   to   him .   Nanny   performs extreamly   well   at   the   Embroidery ,   &   I   hope   the   habit   of application   will   make   her   usefull   to   herself   &   other   people , I   was   afraid   she   wd   never   have   been   either   of   those   things her   Father   &   Mother   are   much   afraid   she   should   be   buried in   Westminster   Abbey   near   the   Lady   that   dyed   by   a the prick   of   her   finger   in   working ,   but   I   will   lay   some   wager on   her   head   she   will   not   be   kill'd   by   diligence .   As   to Jacky   Morgan   he   has   an   admirable   Education   for   a   jockey , he   lives   on   horseback   but   can   neither   read   nor   write . I   hear   Betty   Pitts   Girl   is   very   notable ,   which   I   am   glad   of . My   little   Susan   is   an   excellent   work   woman ,   &   seems   to   have great   talents   for   a   House   maid   when   she   can   get   any   one   to   employ her   in   that   manner ,   I   have   not   yet   learnd   her   to   write but   next   Summer   I   propose   she   should   begin .   My   Brothers   & Mr   Montagu   desire   their   love   to   you ,   &   Compts   to   Lady   Bab to   whom   I   beg   mine .   Mrs   Soted   desires   her   respects .   Pray   if you   converse   with   Mr   &   Mrs   Ellis   make   my   compts   to   them . According   to   the   old   Custom   I   will   wish   you   a   happy   new   year let   day   improve   on   day ,   &   year   on   year , without   a   pain   a   Sorrow   or   a   Fear   is   the   sincere   wish   of   my   Dear Sallys   most   affectionate   sister &   faithfull   friend E Montagu 
BC_1750_EMONTAGU_SS_2	Monday   ye     of   Apr I   will   not   defer   an   instant answering   my   Dear   Sallys   agreable letter   &   its   most   welcome   contents , tho   I   have   not   time   to   say   how much   pleasure   your   kind   promise of   a   visit   gives   me   yet   I   will get   a   moment   for   to   say   I   will if   in   life   &   health ,   be   at   Sandleford on   the   eighth   of   May.   &   as   much sooner   as   I   can ,   to   receive   you   & Lady   Bab.   the   longer   time   you   can give   me   the   more   I   shall   be   obliged to   you   &   her .   I   do   not   think   it   an   unreasonable question   in   April   to   ask   people where   they   will   be   in   May ,   but if   you   have   help'd   me   to   come   speedily to   a   resolution   so   much   the   better , for   it   may   be   as   much   a   misfortune not   to   know   where   one   would   be   as   not to   know   what   one   would   have . I   desire   my   best   complimts   to   Lady Bab   &   that   we   will   take   all   possible care   of   her   at   Sandleford   &   that   our Air   is   very   good   &   the   situation   as healthfull   as   those   recommended   in the   daily   Advertiser .   my   Bror Willy   is   come   to   spend   a   little   time with   us   he   is   at   present   at   the play   or   he   would   send   his   love   but you   may   suppose   it   &   not   be   mistaken .

I   believe   I   may   trouble   you   with   some Commissions   for   getting   me   some Gause   & c   clean'd   for   I   have   fallen   much into   that   kind   of   Wear ,   &   it   dirties sooner   than   I   approve   of .   I   shall   write   you a   longer   letter   next   post   but   would   not A   moment   defer   that   eternal   truth that   your   company   will   always   be a   great   happiness   to   your   truly affect   Sister And   Sincere   friend E:M: Morris   &   My   Bror   Robinson dined   here   yesterday   &   are very   well 
BC_1753_EMONTAGU_FB	Tunbridge   Wells .   ye   of   august I   have   a   thousand   times   reproachd my   self   with   the   stupid   idleness   that   has   so   long made   me   delay   the   pleasure   of   writing   to   Dear   Mrs Boscawen ,   &   the   much   higher   delight   of   hearing from   her .   You   are   so   well   acquainted   with   Tunbridge   as to   know   the   first   of   the   morning   is   dedicated   to   the drinking   the   waters   then   come   the   butter d   rolls   which   sit   heavy on   the   soul   till   dinner ;   the   evening   is   a   time   of dissipation ,   fiddlers   out   of   time   &   out   of   tune   make   a discord   that   they   call   a   concert ,   or   Misses   &   Masters fearfully   &   wonderfully   made ,   throw   themselves   into astonishing   postures   &   surprizing   attitudes   to entertain   you   with   a   minstrel ,   sufficient   to   the   day is   the   pleasure   thereof ,   so   much   has   modern   wit   rectified ancient   custom .   But   I   hope   my   Dear   friend   will   easily believe   I   should   not   have   sufferd   pleasures   independent of   the   great   scheme   of   health   to   have   hinderd   my Writing   to   her .   I   have   been   pursuing   my   health   to   its   proper habitation   the   Mountains   &   hills ,   I   am   living   in   the very   house   my   Dear   Mrs   Boscawen   inhabited   three years   ago ;   at   the   stone   castle   reside   Mr   Pitt ,   Mr , &   Mrs ,   &   Miss   West ;   instead   of   making   parties   at Whist   or   cribbidge ,   &   living   with   &   like   the   beau monde   ,   we   have   been   wandering   about   like   a company   of   gipsies ,   we   dined   in   barns   drank   tea among   rocks ,   visited   all   the   fine   parks   &   seats   in the   neighboring neighborhood   ,   whatever   peice   of   art   time   has consummated   or   decay'd   we   have   viewed ,   new houses   &   ancient   ruins   all   furnish   amusement &   pleasure   to   the   curious   &   elegant   spectator   of   forms . this   vagrant   life   brought   from   the   delicate   constitution &   pale   complexion   of   a   fine   lady   to   the   dusky hue   &   robustness   of   a   gypsy .   I   have   a   good   stomach , sleep   well   all   night ,   laugh   heartily   all   day ,   &   am much   improved   as   to   all   the   ordinary   uses   of   life   since I   came   hither .   I   have   now   only   boasted   of   the Grosser   delights   of   my   Tunbridge   life ,   but   when   you recollect   I   live   in   society   with   Mr   Pitt   &   Mr   West   you   will   imagine the   feast   of   reason   &   the   delicacies   of   wit   have made   the   best   part   of   my   entertainment .   When we   had   pitchd   out   tents   in   some   beautifull   wild   scene , we   seemd   to   be   directed   in   the   choice   as   Mr   Pope says   the   unpoliced unpolished   savages   of   the   early   ages   were by   these because   here   the   streams   in   purer   rills   descend , or   there   the   boughs   with   rudier ruddier   burthens   bend . but   when   the   french   horns   were   breathing   music &   our   companions   conversing   with   all   the   politeness of   mind   &   manners   remedious   retirement   or courtly   life   can   give ,   you   may   imagine   I   felt   how much   we   had   the   advantage   of   untaught   nature &   those   times   of   meer   simplicity   which   in   poetic language   is   calld   the   golden   age ;   however   I   will confess   to   you   I   like   best   this   mixture   of   urbanity &   rural   life ;   our   parties   had   an   air   of   chearfull freedom   that   one   can   never   find   under   the   gilded   dome The   civility   &   delicacy   of   the   drawing   room   was   kept up ,   but   the   ceremony   &   formality   of   it   was   laid   aside . Much   it   would   have   increased   my   pleasure   if   Dear Mrs   Boscawen   had   been   of   our   parties ,   her   good   sense   & wit ,   delicacy   &   gentleness   of   manners   with   her amiable   freedom   &   polite   ease   of   behavior   would have   well   qualified   her   for   this   kind   of   Pastoral   life . to   tell   you   how   often   I   have   thought   of   you   here   would be   to   give   you   an   account   of   every   hour ,   &   I   have only   endeavord   to   give   you   a   short   sketch   of   my manner   of   passing   my   time .   I   know   so   well   how truly   you   partake   of   all   the   pleasures   &   pains   of   your friends ,   to   speak   of   oneself   to   you ,   what   one   is   doing , enjoying ,   or   suffering ,   is   not   telling   an   uninteresting tale .   You   will   see   too   that   my   time   has   been much   taken   up   when   you   add   the   life   of   the gypsy   to   the   engagements   of   a   Tunbridge   Lady for   it   is   not   possible   to   avoid   entering   a   little into   those   things   that   are   calld   the   diversions of   the   place ;   especially   as   there   are   a   number of   people   who   are   angry   that   one   presumes   to be   happy   ones   own   way .   If   one   strikes   into   a   by path   that   leads   one   to   pleasure   &   happiness it   offends   all   who   go   on   in   the   turnpike   road of   life .   We   have   all   been   calld   Muses ,   tho   you know   I   asserted   long   ago   that   Mrs   West   was neither   a   fourth   grace   nor   a   tenth   muse ,   but a   most   excellent   good   woman .   We   have   been   obliged to   see   such   dancing ,   &   listen   to   such   music ,   &   jostle in   such   crouds   as   the   place   presented ,   so   that really   my   engagments   have   been   continual .   Mr Montagu   is   this   day   making   his   bows   to   those august   personnages   the   Mayor   &   Aldermen   of Huntingdon ;   he   spent   a   week   with   me   at   my first   coming   hither ,   he   has   ever   since   been   in the   North ,   but   I   hope   for   the   pleasure   of seeing   him   here   on   saturday   or   monday   next . Dr   Shaw   who   was   here   last   week   was   so   pleased with   the   alteration   the   waters   had   made   in   me that   he   orderd   me   to   drink   them   as   long   as   ever the   season   wd   allow ,   but   as   it   is   not   reasonable to   detain   Mr   Montagu   from   enjoying   the   comfortable retreat   at   Sandleford ,   tho   he   is   so   good   as   to   say he   is   willing   to   stay   with   me   here   as   long   as   I   shall think   it   usefull   to   my   health .   I   propose   only   to keep   him   here   a   week ,   &   then   to   go   with   him   to Sandleford .   My   agreable   friends   I   shall   leave   behind me ,   for   Mr   Pitt   who   is   intirely   recoverd   by   the waters   prudently   determines   to   drink   them   as long   as   the   weather   will   allow :   if   I   had   no   considerations but   my   health   I   should   do   so   too ,   but   I   know the   life   one   must   lead   here   can   never   be   agreable to   Mr   Montagu ,   who   loves   his   books   &   retired leisure ,   &   the   more   freely   ones   friend   offers   to sacrifice   their   pleasures   to   ones   advantage   the More   one   is   piqued   in   generosity ,   not   to   suffer   it . If   my   silence   was   a   fault   this   long   letter   must   be   a merit ,   if   my   letter   is   troublesome   I   am   sure   of   some merit   in   having   delay'd   it   so   long ,   for   one   or   other of   these   things   pray   give   me   thanks   by   the first   post ,   for   believe   me   I   long   to   hear   from   you . think   of   you   often   with   equal   esteem   &   tenderness , &   talk   of   you   frequently   with   Mr   West   who   loves &   honors   you   extreamly .   Mr   Botham   gave   me the   pleasure   of   hearing   you   was   well ,   but   awakend in   me   all   the   odious   pains   of   envy   when   he   told   me he   had   spent   some   hours   with   you .   Let   me   entreat , beseech ,   implore   you   not   to   punish   my   silence   with the   long   delay   of   an   answer   to   my   letter .   Let   me have   the   pleasure   of   hearing   how   you   amuse yourself ,   what   are   your   amusemts   &   occupations , and   ( tho   I   know   I   shall   again   fall   into   the   offence   of envy )   who   has   been   of   your   society .   Above   all   things Do   me   the   honor   &   the   justice   to   believe   me   with a   regard   not   to   be   express'd   in   words ,   Dear   Mrs Boscawens   most   faithfull , most   affectionate   Friend , Obliged   &   Obedt   Hble   Servt E   Montagu 
BC_1753_EMONTAGU_GW	Novber   ye     My   most   honor'd   Cousin Most   truly   hath   the   wise   man   said there   is   a   time   to   rejoyce   &   a   time   to   mourn ,   but   we shortsighted   mortals   know   not   always   the   proper Seasons ,   thus   was   my   excellent   Cousin   rejoycing   in my   recovery   at   the   very   time   I   was   become   ill   again : but   still   his   joy   is   not   thrown   away ,   &   is   a   cordial of   such   virtue   as   to   restablish   my   new   returning   health . Last   saturday   noon   soon   after   my   return   from   taking the   air   in   the   post   chaise   I   was   seized   with   a   nervous tremor   &   great   disorder ,   upon   which   I   went   to   bed ,   in about   two   hours   the   agitation   abated ,   &   left   no   complaint but   weakness   &   languor ,   &   such   a   degree   of   fever   as generally   succeeds   to   these   violent   attacks   .   I   have   been very   carefull   of   myself ,   have   kept   my   person   within the   limits   of   my   dressing   room ,   my   mind   but   have   only Gently   recreated   in   the   fields   of   fancy .   I   order'd   my apothecary   to   send   from   Newbury   along   with   some Nervous   medicines ,   Homers   Odyssey ,   imagining   my   confinemt And   solitude   would   be   well   inliven'd enliven'd   by   the   adventures of   the   Man   who ,   wandering   from   clime   to   clime ,   observant   stray Their   manners   noted   &   their   states   survey'd .   I   was   the   more desirous   to   read   them   as   two   poets   for   whom   I   have   great   honor prefer   this   tunefull   bard   as   a   teacher   of   morals   to   the severer   philosophers ,   for   whose   precepts   the   mind   enervated by   sickness   is   too   weak ;   and   indeed   this   has   answerd   as all   must   do   which   is   undertaken   by   so   good   direction , and   I   have   passd   my   hours   in   no   unpleasing   indolence , lolling   in   my   great   chair   with   the   oddyssey odyssey   in   my   hand . but But   unfortunate   is   the   mind   that   is   too   delicate   to bear   the   voice   of   wisewidsedom wi d   unless   attempted   by   Apollo's   Lyre &   must   have   an   example   of   virtue   &   patience   beautified with   all   the   coloring   of   fancy   &   soften'd   with   the   skelf touch   of   art   to   make   it   a   fit   object   for   their   tender sight .   Ulysses   refuses   to   listen   to   the   Syrens   tho   they promise   him   instruction ,   so   wary   is   wisedom ,   when   the voice   is   too   soothing   to   the   ear ,   but   he   had   a   soul that   could   not   be   immersed   in   the   waves   of   affliction ,   mine not   able   to   buffet   the   stream ,   must   borrow   even   the   bladder of   vanity   to   bear   it   up .   I   have   given   you   this   notable Account   of   my   amusements   to   shew   you   first   that   I   have   not been   not   been   very   ill ,   secondly   that   there   is   no   time   nor occasion   in   which   your   friendship   does   not   profit   me , &   thirdly   &   lastly ,   because   I   had   nothing   else   to   say &   was   not   wise   enough   to   take   that   hint   to   be silent .   You   are   now   a   man   of   pleasure ,   visiting   Ladies , feasting   in   princely   bowers ,   &   living   ( I   was   going   to   say being   full   of   the   odyssey )   like   Penelopes   Suitors   rioting at   the   expence   of   a   widow'd   dame ,   consuming   the fruits   of   the   earth ,   &   soothing   your   cares   with   the   music of   her   Ladyships   harpsicord ;   but   when   you   return   to Wickham ,   to   your   usefull   books   &   serious   muse ,   I must   grow   more   discreet ,   &   not   break   in   upon   your sacred   hours   with   letters   of   such   intolerable   length . I   am   very   glad   of   the   account   you   give   of   Mr   Pitt during   his   stay   at   Hagley ,   I   hope   the   Bath   waters   will quite   set   him   right   either   with   or   without   the gout ,   as   to   the   second   part   of   your   story   it   pleases me   not   so   well ,   for   I   do   not   think   we   shall   come to   Town   in   november ,   certainly   we   shall   not ,   unless there   be   something   of   more   than   ordinary   business going   forward   in   the   house   of   commons ,   you   will Say   perhaps   I   may   be   ill   again !   why   if   that   should happen   I   must   take   more   nervous   medicine   & read   the   Iliad   I   think .   Shaw   or   his   great   Sire   OEsculapius could   do   me   no   service ;   I   have   had   the   same   disorder so   often   in   my   life   I   know   how   to   manage   it   as   well as   the   learned   faculty ;   warmth   &   quiet   are   the   best remedies ,   the   woods   offer   both .   I   have   quite   left   off my   evening   airings ,   &   shall   no   more   like   drive   my   chariot   thro   the   realms   of   night   till sultry   days   recommend   the   evening   hour .   I   am   very glad   you   have   got   safe   to   Stoke ,   I   was   not   without anxiety   for   you   while   at   such   a   distance   from home   at   this   season   of   the   year .   I   hope   you   will   enjoy good   health   this   winter   after   all   the your   exercise   you have   had ,   which   must   certainly   be   very   beneficial . as   soom   as   Xmass   is   over   I   promise   myself   the happiness   of   seeing   you ,   till   then ,   I   can   have   no   greater pleasure   than   hearing   you   are   well .   Your   amour with   a   certain   person   goes   on   well ?   What   to   Fulham again ?   Smiles   from   reason   flow ,   &   are   of   love   the   food . but   really   you   love   as   if   every   month   were   may To   quit   your   habitation   at   this   time   of   the   year   to   go to   that   damp   cold   place .   I   have   been   reading   Ariosto , &   I   can   find   nothing   in   Orlando   furioso ,   or   non   furioso , that   equals   it .   You   are   very   good   in   thinking   of   poor Mr   Botham .   how   many   would   think   themselves   unhappy if   they   had   not   money   to   adorn   their   gardens   & parks ,   to   have   collections   or   rare   plants   &   fine aromatic   shrubs .   how How   much   more   may   he   reasonably desire   to   have   what   is   necessary   for   the   education of   his   pretty   Babes !   to   cultivate   their   ,   perdure their   talents ,   &   give   them   the   noble   virtues   that are   rarely   found   but   in   persons   of   liberal   education &   competent   circumstances !   when   once   the   virtues have   taken   root   they   grow   perhaps   the   faster   fixd for   being   shaken   by   the   storms   of   fortune ,   but   while they   are   young   &   tender ,   the   cold   blast   hinders   their shoot ,   &   kills   the   opening   bud .   My   sweet   little   Harry is   laying   his   careless   head   upon   my   lap   at   this instant ,   nothing   sensible   of   your   generous   or   my anxious   care   for   his   future   wellbeing ,   happy   season When   neither   hopes   nor   fears   dance   before   the   mental   eye   diverting its   alteration   from   present   objects .   I   do   not   expect   Mr   Botham here   before   tuesday ,   I   will   certainly   tell   him   all   the   kind   &   friendly things   you   say ,   he   is   a   truly   pious   &   virtuous   man ,   &   we   hope of   the   righteous   shall   not   fail   but   when   or   where   they   shall be   answerd   we   know   not ,   it   ought   to   satisfy   us   that   we know   the   time   will   come .   Mr   Montagu   desires   his   best compts   to   you   &   Mrs   West   my   most   affectionate   respects   attend her . I   am My   most   esteem'd   Cousins very   faithfull   &   affectionte   Friend and   Most   Obliged   Hble   Servt Eliza:   Montagu . 
BC_1756_EMONTAGU_CL	Hillstreet   ye   . d   Apr.   Sir One   of   the   most   vexatious   circumstances attending   my   late   indisposition   was   being   unable   to return   thanks   for   the   favor   of   your   obliging   letter . I   had   fully   proposed   writing   to   you   the   day   after Miss   West   left   me ,   &   to   inform   you   that   she   was   gone to   the   Bath ,   but   I   was   taken   very   ill ,   &   had   so   violent a   cough   that   I   could   not   bear   the   posture   of   writing . I   am   now   pretty   well   again ,   two   days   of   sunshine are   very   beneficial   to   an   invalid ,   my   cough   has left   me   &   I   hope   to   recover   a   better   state   of   health than   I   have   enjoy'd   for   some   time .   The   death   of   poor Mr   West   shock'd   me   very   much :   many   amiable   qualities , a   heart   uncorrupted   by   the   World ,   the   piety   &   virtue that   were   stamp'd   on   all   his   actions   &   conversation ,   and   as uncommon   sincerity   of   character ,   made   him   very   valuable to   his   friends ,   a   Life   of   retirement   &   sequestration from   the   business   &   bustle   of   the   World   gave   him   the innocence   of   a   hermit ,   to   which   was   join'd   the   politeness &   delicacy   of   a   gentleman ,   &   the   acquired   endowments of   a   scholar   with   a   great   share   of   natural   wit   &   vivacity . One   feels   the   loss   of   so   good ,   &   at   the   same   time   so singular   a   person ,   the   more ,   as   one   knows   on   shall   never look   upon   his   like   again .   Few   people   quit   the   World   but From   imbecillity   or   moroseness .   the   course   of   his   fortunes had   thrown   him   onto   retirement ,   a   philosophick disposition   made   him   happy   in   it .   The   time   I   used to   pass   at   Wickham   after   being   tired   of   the   vanities of   this   magnificent   Citty ,   &   of   the   train   of   conversation where   dissimulation   or   habit   make   all   appear   of the   same   sentiments ,   was   very   agreable ,   so   that   I lament   the   loss   of   the   friend   &   the   companion .   Poor   Miss Wests   share   of   the   misfortune   added   to   my   concern the   tenderness   &   fortitude   with   which   she   went   through the   last   sad   scene   with   her   Brother   added   to   my former   high   esteem   of   her .   I   have   just   received   a   letter from   my   sister   at   Bath   expressing   herself   much pleased   with   the   conversation   of   Miss   West ,   &   I   hope my   Sister   will   do   every   thing   in   her   power   to   amuse her .   I   hope   I   need   not   say   that   I   am   mortified   the first   Mitre   is   not   destined   to   the   head   that   would best   deserve   it .   I   mention'd   as   my   own   observation   how much   it   was   the   D-   of   N-s   personal   interest   that you   should   be   on   the   Bench   rather   than   any   one that   had   different   connections ,   yr   Brother   said   it was   very   true ,   &   that   his   Grace   was   so   sensible   of it   as   to   wish   it   for   his   own   sake ,   but   the   urgency of   present   considerations   might   at   present   over balance   it .   The   Archbishop   of   Canterbury   is   declining very   fast ,   &   the   Bishop   of   London   is   much   weaker Than   he   was   a   few   months   ago .   I   think   there   has   not pass'd   any   thing   remarkable   in   the   House   of   Commons of   late ,   except   a   very   fierce   contention   about   the   new   Road , the   Dukes   of   Bedford   &   Grafton   are   in   violent   opposition to   each   other ,   the   bill   for   the   Road   wd   probably   have been   carried   if   there   had   not   been   an   interposition on   the   part   of   the   Bishop   of   London   who   is   interested in   it   &   had   not   been   consulted .   The   King   is   in   perfect health ,   &   the   apprehensions   of   an   invasion   seem   to be   over .   Mr   Boscawen   is   going   to   Portsmouth to   take   a   command   in   the   channel ;   he   is   so full   of   a   laudable   ambition   to   signalize   himself &   of   a   patriot   animosity   towards   the   french ,   supported by   an   undaunted   resolution ,   that   I   imagine   if it   be   possible   to   construe   the   letter   of   instructing into   a   permission   to   attack   he   will   seek   an opportunity   to   engage   with   our   Enemies .   Mrs Boscawen   you   may   imagine   is   not   at   her   ease , but   behaves   like   the   wife   of   an   English   Admiral . Miss   Pitt   was   not   averse   to   change   the   primrose paths   of   Wickham   for   the   still   more   gay   paths of   pleasure   in   this   Town ,   she   is   now   with   Mrs Nedham   in   Germanstreet .   Mr   Pitt   is   to   settle at   Heys   very   soon .   Lord   Feversham   keeps   to   his grief   &   his   black   chariot   as   if   he   were   to   live to   the   term   of   an   Antediluvian .   The   Papists are   very   active   in   their   spleen   against   Mr Bower ,   but   people   seem   tired   of   attending   to   them Mrs   Pococke   has   thrown   away   her   stick   &   her   staff , &   leans   wholly   on   the   Episcopal   Crosier .   I   am   assured that   she   is   restored   to   perfect   youth   since   the   Doctor   is   made a   Bishop .   Sr   George   Lyttelton   &   Miss   Lyttelton   went   yesterday   to Deal   Castle   to   make   a   visit   to   Admiral   Smyth ,   who   I   dare say   is   as   happy   as   Neptune   himself   now   he   has   got   such good   friends   with   him .   I   cannot   include   my   letter   without chiding   you   for   an   expression   so   improper   I   cannot   imagine how   it   could   slip   from   one   who   is   usually   so   happy in   the   choice   of   their   terms ,   after   having   mentiond your   situation   as   to   the   vacant   Bishoprick   you   say you   shd   apologise   for   dwelling   so   long   on   your   private affairs .   Pray   Sir   how   comes   the   Deans   of   Exeters   interest to   be   a   private   affair ?   surely   in   this   instance   it   is   a Publick   concern !   nor   can   any   thing   that   relates   to your   happiness   ever   be   so   far   private   that   many , &   particularly   the   Madonna ,   will   not   be   intirely interested   in   it .   To   convince   me   you   are   corrected   by   my reprimand ,   I   hope   you   will   always   let   me   know   if there   be   any   thing   to   be   said   which   yr   delicacy   might chuse   not   to   mention   yourself .   I   shall   have   great pleasure   in   obeying   any   hint   of   yours ,   &   be   glad   of any   thing   that   will   give   occasion   to   having   the pleasure   of   a   letter   from   you .   I   did   not   mention   to   any one   but   Miss   West   that   I   had   had   a   letter   from   you . Whenever   you   are   at   leisure   I   shall   be   glad   to   hear   you are   well .   I   am   Sir   with   great   regard   Your   Obliged   &   Obedt Hble   Servt   E   Montagu 
BC_1757_EMONTAGU_BS	Sandleford   ye     of   Sept Dear   Sir You   had   so   generously   overpaid   your reckoning   in   the   pleasure   your   last   letter   gave   me ,   I   would have   shewn   a   meritorious   moderation   in   forbearing   to   trouble you   so   soon   again ,   if   I   had   not   received   a   letter   from   the   Dean   of Exeter   yesterday   which   tells   me   Lord   Lyttelton   is   extreamly mortified   that   you   did   not   go   to   Hagley   when   you   left Malvern ,   &   that   he   will   be   greatly   disappointed   if   you   forget the   kind   promise   you   made   him   of   passing   this   season   with him .   I   thought   therefore   it   would   not   be   amiss   to   intimate   this to   you ,   and   the   more   cant   think   you   are   not   sensible   of   the degree   of   mortification   any   one   must   feel   that   is   deprived   of your   company   perhaps   you   may   be   able   to   give   some   share of   you   time   to   Hagley   which   will   make   Lord   Lyttelton   very happy ,   &   I   hope   you   will   pardon   my   giving   you   this   hint   as I   find   you   were   very   earnestly   wish'd   for ,   &   from   what   had pass'd   in   London   I   believe   absolutely   expected .   The   moderation I   had   profess'd   at   the   beginning   of   my   letter   might   induce me   to   leave   off   here ,   but   having   so   much   regard   to   my   friends pleasure   you   will   allow   me   to   have   some   indulgence   to   my own   amusement .   I   hoped   before   this   time   Sandleford   would have   had   a   better   Secretary ,   for   you   must   know   Sir   Dr   Monsey is   fallen   desperately   in   love   with   me   &   I   am   most   passionately   in   love   with him ,   the   darts   on   both   sides   have   not   been   the   porcupine's   but   the grey   goose   quill .   We   have   said   so   many   tender   things   to   each other   by   the   post   that   at   last   we   thought   it   would   be   better   to sigh   in   soft   dialogue   than   by   letter .   we We   agreed   to   meet ,   &   the rather ,   as   all   the   Lovers   we   had   read   of   ( &   being   in   love   with each   other   only   du   coté   de   l'esprit   you   may   suppose   we   woo   by book )   had   always   complaind   of   absence   as   the   most   dreadfull thing   imaginable .   He   said ,   nay   he   swore ,   he   would   come   to Sandleford ,   &   twice   had   named   the   day ,   but   each   time   his granddaughter   fell   sick ,   &   I   know   not   whether   he   will   keep the   third   appointment   which   is   for   next   Monday .   these   disappointments have   made   me   resolve ,   &   I   really   believe   it   won't will   not be   difficult   to   keep   the   resolution ,   never   again   to   fall   in love   with   a   Man   who   is   a   Grandfather .   In   all   other   respects the   Doctor   is   a   perfect   Pastor   Fido   &   I   believe   when   we   get   to the   Elysium   all   the   Lovers   who   wander   in   the   Myrtle   Groves there   will   throw   their   garlands   at   our   feet .   Hero   &   Leander ,   Anthony &   Cleopatra ,   &   others   who   formerly   made   some   figure   in   Loves Legends   will   appear   but   vulgar   sweet   hearts   to   us .   I   hear   Mrs Price   is   a   little   jealous   of   me ,   but   I   would   advise   her   to   make herself   easy ,   for   all   young   Men   are   Volage   ;   &   she   will   have   her revenge   when   I   shall   in   my   turn   complain of   slighted   vows   &   cold   disdain ; but   at   present   I   think   I   reign   absolute   Sovereign   over   his   affections The   Gods   take   care   of   Cato ,   Emin   is   still   alive   &   well   in   spite   of all   the   hardships   he   suffers .   I   am   sorry   to   hear   people   talk   of another   engagment .   I   wish   for   fear   of   accidents   my   Peacock Throne   was   coming   with   the   other   treasure   from   Stadt .   Since you   have   found   out   my   enthusiasm   I   hope   you   will   rank   it with   Peter   the   Greats   love   of   polite   arts ,   &   Emins   passion for   liberty ,   for   considering   I   am   of   the   nation   of   Women   who are   disinherited   both   by   nature   &   custom   both   of   extraordinary talents ,   it   is   as   generous   in   me   to   admire   them ,   as   it   was   for   a Russian   Bear   to   wish   to   polish   his   Country ,   or   a   Persian   slave to   desire   his   countrymen   may   be   free ;   nay   more   so ,   for   they   could   participate of   the   advantages   they   would   give ,   &   I   cannot ,   &   yet ,   as   you   imagine , I   should   be   happy   enough   if   I   could   protect   excellence   where &   in   whatever   it   was   found .   I   would   not   like   the   queen   of Sweden   fill   my   Court   with   Savants   &   Philosophers ,   for   it   is not   the   proper   climate   for   them ,   but   I   would   give   them   a   good establishment   in   Academies ,   &   the   rays   of   favour   should   shine   on them   if   they   inhabited   the   farthest   degree   of   the   Poles .   I   have too   much   respect   for   Science   to   expose   it   to   the   seductions   of a   court .   when When   the   Chymist   leaves   his   laboratory   &   instead   of inquiring   into   the   secrets   of   nature   is   prying   into   those   of   the cabinet   council ,   &   the   mathematician   studies   the   law   of   nations instead   of   the   Laws   of   motion ,   they   are   ill   employ d   &   business is   ill   perform'd .   It   was   as   absurd   in   Christina   to   turn   her   Philosophers into   privy   Councellors   as   it   would   be   to   put   Mr   Gray   at   the head   of   the   Tapestry   Manufacture   because   he   has   wove   a web   for   Edwards   line   with   the   noblest   images   of   Poetry . I   am   not   quite   satisfied   with   what   the   Malvern   waters   have done   for   your   health ,   but   I   acquit   them   of   having   spoild   your Taste .   I   shall   readily   consent   to   revisit   Mr   Morris's   ,   I   hardly   want the   temptation   of   your   company   to   go   thither .   Experience   is   an infallible   judge ,   &   I   believe   you   are   very   right   in   your   choice of   a   situation   for   this   climate ,   we   have   more   occasion   for   Wood to   burn   than   to   keep   us   from   being   burnt .   I   have   not   been able   to   prevail   on   Tom   &   his   Turtle   to   come   to   Sandleford   tho a   pair   of   Lovers   in   London   seem   to   be   improperly   situated . I   expect   my   second   Brother ,   his   wife ,   &   two   of   my   younger   Brothers here   next   week ,   &   Mrs   Boscawen   is   to   give   me   the   pleasure , I   may   say   happiness   of   seeing   her   ye the   beginning   of   October , but   all   this   does   not   make   me   less   regret   that   I   have   no hopes   of   seeing   Mr   Stillingfleet .   I   do   not   indeed   hope   to   see him   on   the   Persian   throne ,   or   giving   Law   to   the   East ,   but I   know   he   sits   on   the   summit   of   Human   virtue   &   obeys   the Laws   of   him   who   made   that   World   the   ambitious   are   contending for ,   and   to   such   only   my   esteem   pays   homage ,   and   as   such I   can   with   great   truth   assure   him   I   am   with   the   highest   esteem His   most   faithfull affectionate   &   Obliged Humble   Servant E Montagu If   this   finds   you   at   Mr   Prices I   beg   my   most   respectfull   compts to   him .   If   I   knew   how   Statira   should address   Roxana   I   would   make   same to   Mrs   Price . 
BC_1757_EMONTAGU_ED	Kings   Weston   thursday   night   My   Dearest I   came   to   this   place   yesterday   &   never were   my   eyes   so   entertaind   with   fine   views ,   from   my Dressing   Room   I   look   upon   a   reach   of   the   Severn Sea   of   near     miles   in   length   &   many   in   breadth ,   the ships   lying   before   my   window ,   the   eye   is   led   to   this prospect   over   a   fine   Country   well   wooded   &   very   green the   land   prospects   are   rich   &   gay ,   &   upon   ye   whole it   is   the   finest   place   I   ever   saw ,   the   House   is a   very   good   one ,   the   Lady   of   the   Mansion   is   worthy of   all   the   charms   of   the   situation .

BC_1758_EMONTAGU_BS_1	The     of   june   Dear   Sir It   has   always   been   an   abatement   to my   pleasure   in   corresponding   with   you   that   I   was taking   up   the   time   you   could   employ   to   more   usefull purpose   or   agreable   amusement ,   &   I   could   never   find an   hour   in   which   my   letter   could   properly   steal in   upon   you .   but   even   the   unhappy   have   their moments ,   &   I   have   at   last   found   one   most   suitable to   me ;   which   is   when   you   are   in   the   Coblers   library , after   Bunyan   &   quarter ,   those   classicks   of   ye   artifices in   leather ,   I   think   I   may   properly   come   in ,   &   as I   shall   talk   of   Heroes ,   talk   of   Kings ,   armaments &   navies ,   expect   to   take   ye   par   of   ye   biographer of   the   Seven   champions   tho   I   know   his   history   is adorn'd   with   cuts .   In   the   first   place   I   congratulate you   on   our   success   in   Africa ,   some   account   of   it you   will   have   seen   in   the   news   papers ,   but   I may   add   that   we   shall   now   serve   our   selves   with a   certain   gum   necessary   in   staining   cottons for   which   we   used   to   expend   sixty   thousand   pounds a   Year .   This   affair   was   affected   by   an   honest   rough Sea   Captain   whose   name   is   Marsh ,   who   owes his   advancement   in   ye   Navy   to   Mr   Boscawen . Prince   Ferdinands   passing   ye   Rhine   is   lookd upon   by   the   skillfull   in   War   as   a   very   great peice   of   Generalship ,   &   our   Gracious   Sovereign is   much   delighted   with   the   event .   All   English hearts   are   in   palpitations   for   what   this   week is   to   bring   forth ,   we   expect   hourly   to   hear of   the   success   of   our   attack   upon   St   Malo's   of a   battle   daily   expected   to   be   performd   by that   great   Master   of   the   science   of   defence the   King   of   Prussia ,   &   of   what   has   happend at   Louisbourg .   Our   troops   landed   at   St   Malo's without   opposition ,   but   what   dire   contention may   have   fallen   out   since   we   know   not . there   was   a   report   yesterday   that   ye   place was   carried   by   ye   loss   of   a   thousand   of   our   Men but   thank   God   it   was   merely   a   rumour . So   much   for   War   &   Wars   alarms ;   as   to   our civil   occurrences   they   have   been   so   boisterously carried   I   need   not   change   the   tone   of   my   narrative All   the   Judges   the   Lord   Keeper ,   the   Chief   Justice &   the   late   Ld   Chancellor   gave   their   opinions against   ye   habeas   corpus   bill   Ld   Temple much   in   wrath   insulted   ye   Judges   in   some of   his   questions ,   Ld   Lyttelton   warmly   &   sharply reproved   him   upon   which   words   rose   so   high the   House   of   Lords   interposed .   The   last   day of   this   bill   Ld   Mansfield   &   Lord   Hardwicke spoke   so   full   to   the   matter ,   even   ye   Tory Lords   &   these   most   violent   in   their   wishes for   it   declared   they   were   convinced   ye   new bill   was   dangerous   to   liberty   in   many   respects , in   many   absurd ;   so   that   had   there   been   a division   there   wd   not   have   been   four   votes for   it   but   Mr   Pitts   party   discreetly   avoided a   division .   This   affair   has   not   set   the   legislative Wisedom   of   ye   House   of   Commons   in   a   very high   light ,   but   the   great   Mr   Beckford   whom No   arguments   can   convince ,   no   defeat   make ashamed ,   nor   mistake   make   diffident ,   did on   the   notion   for   a   vote   of   credit   stand   up in   ye   house   of   Commons   &   say ,   he   wd   not oppose   that   measure   as   he   had   an   opinion of   ye   two   Commoners   in   ye   administration but   in   ye   Peers   that   composed   it ,   he   had no   confidence ,   &   ran   on   in   foul   abuse   of them ,   &   then   ended   with   a   severe   censure on   ye   house   of   Lords   in   general .   Ld   Royston answerd   him   that   this   was   unparliamentary in   being where   personal ,   &   indecent   in   regard   to ye   house   of   Peers   in   general ,   to   which   Mr Pitt   answerd   with   great   heat   that   he   was sorry   to   hear   such   language   from   a   Gentleman who   was   to   be   a   Peer ;   he   set   forth   ye great   importance   &   dignity   of   Mr   Beckford personally ,   &   above   all   the   dignity   & importance   of   an   Alderman ,   considering it   was   a   title   he   shd should   be   more   proud   of than   that   of   a   Peer   This   speech   has enraged   ye   Lords ,   offended   the   Commons , &   the   Citty   ungratefully   say ,   it   was   too gross .   Those   who   wish   well   to   this   Country &   consequently   to   an   union   of   parties   at this   juncture   are   very   sorry   for   these   heats ,   it   is well   if   they   do   not   unsolder   ye   union Lady   F:   Williams   is   set   out   for   Hampton Court   to   day .   I   have   pass'd   a   good   deal   of time   at   Ealing   since   you   left   us   &   the fresh   air   has   done   some   service   to   my health   which   you   so   kindly   enquire   after I   began   Islington   waters   to   day .   I   am   anxious for   Mr   Emin ,   who   went   with   Commodore   Howe . I   can   give   credit   very   easily   to   what   you   say of   ye   potatoes   they   make   a   fine   meal   & better   starch   than   ye   finest   wheat .   &   I   have known   ye   potatos   meal   put   into   pudding because   better   than   wheat   flour .   Ld   Chesterfield exhorted   ye   Irish   to   make   starch   of   it .   Thank God   we   have   a   prospect   of   a   good   Harvest   from ye   refreshing   rains   we   have   had   of   late . I   will   give   you   immediate   intelligence   of ye   event   of   our   Enterprize ,   &   shd   till   it   was decided   have   delay d   writing ,   if   I   had   not thought   my   letter   now   wd   suit   so   well   with your   present   studies .   I   am   afraid   my   letter is   hardly   legible ,   but   Dr   &   Mrs   Mille   staid with   me   till   after   ye   first   bell   had   gone   by &   as   the   ancient   histories   of   St   George   & ye   Dragon   & c   are   usually   in   ye   black   letter my   manuscript   will   still   suit   ye   better with   ye   books   you   have   been   reading .   I   am delighted   with   yr   Idea   of   Torri   &   his   family I   expect   to   see   some   of   them   in   ye   advertiser stolen   or   stray d .   I   shall   think   they   have   good luck   who   find   either   Mr   Arnold   or   his   Agues Agnes   . I   hope   you   will   find   benefit   from   Cheltenham waters ,   &   do   not   doubt   of   your   finding   pleasure at   Foxly .   I   must   tell   you   that   with   all   your taste   you   make   a   very   false   judgment   of your   own   letters .   I   will   allow   you   to   say   it   may give   you   some   trouble   to   write   them ,   but   pray   do   not assert   that   I   have   not   great   pleasure   in   reading them   for   it   becomes   not   a   descendant   of   ye   great   Bishop Stillingfleet   to   tell   a   fib . I   am   with   great   regard   yr   most   Obliged E M 
BC_1758_EMONTAGU_BS_2	Carr:ville   ye     of   Aug Dear   Sir I   have   often   had   occasion   to   apologize   for troubling   you   too   frequently   with   my   letters ,   &   ceremony   would   intimate   I   should   now   make   an   excuse   for   not   having written   sooner   to   thank   you   for   your   kind   &   agreable   letter , perhaps   you   who   are   ready   to   think   the   best   of   yr   friends imagine   I   have   corrected   an   impertinent   disposition   &   am   grown more   temperate   in   the   use   of   pen   &   ink ,   but   indeed   I   am just   the   same   sort   of   Woman   I   was ,   but   of   late   am   become very   rich ,   which   I   assure   you   is   one   of   the   greatest   afflictions that   can   befall   a   rational   creature .   I   will   delineate   my misfortunes ,   &   if   you   was   not   nursed   by   tygers   &   suckled by   Wolves   you   will   weep   for   me .   I   am   angry   that   l'embarras des   richesses   has   been   exhibited   in   a   farce ,   I   think   it one   of   the   finest   subjects   in   the   World   for   a   tragedy , and   if   the   Muses   would   visit   Northumberland   I   would compose   a   mournfull   Drama   intitled   the   Woes   of Wealth .   I   desired   Dr   Monsey   to   acquaint   you   with   the death   of   Mr   Rogers ,   which   happend   soon   after   I   had your   letter .   Many   letters   were   to   be   written   in   order   to procure   him   most   pompous   funeral   obsequies   according to   the   fashion   of   Northumberland .   as   he   was   allied   to the   people   of   the   first   rank   in   the   County   &   they   were all   to   be   at   the   funeral   this   was   a   very   ceremonious Affair ,   &   that   &   the   ordering   mourning   for   his   domesticks &   dependants ,   kept   me   emply d   for   some   time ,   my   own family   was   also   to   be   put   into   mourning ,   a   house was   to   be   got   in   Northumberland   to   receive   us ,   many things   to   be   settled   in   ye   London   &   at   Sandleford   before so   long   a   journey ,   &   all   this   happening   when   I   was   a feeble   infirm   sort   of   an   animal   kept   me   fully   employd My   Sister   was   so   good   as   to   come   to   Hillstreet   to   spend a   little   time   with   me   before   I   set   out ,   which   was   a   comfort amidst   my   troubles ,   but   still   took   up   my   time ,   however I   promised   my   self   that   as   soon   as   I   got   into   the   North I   should   have   time   to   write   to   all   my   friends .   The     of august   at   noon   we   got   to   Durham   &   there   began   hurrys &   ceremonies   that   have   continued   to   this   day   &   I   know   not when   I   shall   see   a   quiet   hour .   At   Durham   we   were met   by   a   great   number   of   Mr   Rogers   relations   &   the Receivers   &   agents   of   his   estate   who   attended   us   in   great form   till   we   got   to   Newcastle ,   where   we   were   to   stay   two or   three   days   with   a   relation   of   Mr   Montagus   till   our house   was   aired .   We   had   not   been   an   hour   at   Newcastle before   we   had   the   complimts   of   the   principal   persons of   the   Corporation   &   in   the   Town ,   the   next   morning   visits began ,   &   when   there   will   be   an   end   of   them   I   cannot tell .   We   had     people   to   dine   here   on   Sunday ,   a   family yesterday ,   people   about   business   to   day ,   &   three   families are   to   dine   here   to   morrow ,   in   the   morning   I   am   up   to the   elbows   in   dusty   parchments   &   accounts ,   at   dinner as   busy   as   an   hostess   of   an   Inn   attending   her   guests , at   night   as   sick   as   an   invalid   in   an   hospital and   these   are   the   woes   of   wealth .   Sure   they   are   woes   indeed And   I   am   not   une   malade   imaginaire   .   I   begin   to   envy   your   Philosophes &   think   it   is   better   to   have   only   money   enough   to   procure one   Christian   burial .   Now   I   have   utter d   some   of   my   miseries   I must   tell   you   I   have   some   amusement   in   seeing   a   Country so   different   from   any   I   have   ever   been   in .   Riches   here   lye   very deep ,   but   avarice   would   dive   to   the   center   for   them ,   by   engines of   different   sorts ,   some   of   which   draw   off   ye   water ,   Coals   are brought   up   from   an   immense   depth ,   other   inventions   obviate the   difficulty   of   carriage ,   &   by   means   of   what   are   calld the   waggon   ways ,   great   burthens   of   Coals   are   moved with   little   force   &   easily   carried   to   the   sea   side .   Coals   that now   lye     fathom   below   the   surface   of   the   earth   by   next summer   may   be   carried   in   a   gentlemans   pocket   to   Arthurs &   what   has   employ d   many   strong   hands   to   dig   it   filld   many a   waggon ,   &   freighted   a   Ship ,   shall   lye   in   a   silken purse   &   pass   from   one   owner   to   another   by   ye   speedy decision   of   a   toss   up .   Mr   Rogers   family   mansion   having been   uninhabited   for   many   years   was   not   fit   for   our reception ,   his   house   in   Newcastle   was   not   agreably   situated for   the   Summer ,   so   we   hired   a   House   on   the   banks   of the   Tyne   for   the   occasion ,   it   is   a   very   pretty   house extreamly   well   furnished   &   most   agreably   situated , Ships   &   other   vessels   from   Newcastle   are   sailing by   every   hour ,   the   River   here   is   broad   &   of   a   good colour ,   &   we   have   a   large   reach   of   it .   &   We   have a   very   good   turnpike   road   to   the   Sea   side ,   where   I should   pass   a   great   deal   of   my   time   if   it   was   not all   engross d   by   company .   But   we   are   in   ye   midst   of the   largest   neighbourhood   I   ever   saw ,   &   some   of   these Gentlemen   by   means   of   Coal   mines   have   immense   fortunes . There   is   more   civility   &   hospitality   here   than   in   the   Counties near   London .   Provisions   are   very   dear ,   except   fish .   Hay   was L   a   Ton   here   a   little   while   ago   but   they   have   of   late imported   a   good   deal   which   has   sunk   the   price .   The   Land hereabouts   is   much   of   it   very   rich ,   but   the   Coal   trade being   very   gainfull   little   attention   is   given   to   agriculture &   I   do   not   wonder   they   have   little   good   hay   for   they let   it   lye   a   fortnight   or   longer   in   the   fields   at   ye   mercy of   ye   Weather .   There   seems   a   greater   portion   of   luxury   & extravagance   at   Newcastle   than   at   London .   I   hope   you   will not   punish   me   according   to   my   deserts   by   not   letting   me   hear from   you   of   a   long   time .   Where   are   Mr   & /   Mrs   Torriano ?   I   hope   they are   well .   Pray   make   my   compts   to   them   when   you   see   them &   hint   to   Mr   Torriano   that   I   wish   his   Parents   had   caused him   to   be   taught   to   write .   I   desire   my   best   &   most   gratefull compts   to   Mr   &   Mrs   Price .   I   need   not   desire   you   to   tell   Lady Sophia   Egerton   &   the   Bishop   of   Bangor   I   am   always much   their   Humble   Servant .   I   congratulate   you   on   the taking   of   Louisbourg   the   news   of   it   has   just   reachd   us it   makes   me   very   happy   on   account   of   ye   Publick consequence   &   also   as   it   touches   my   friend   Mrs   Boscawen . I   have   not   a   direction   to   Foxley ,   so   am   obliged   to   send this   to   Monsey ,   where   it   will   find   him   I   know   not for   he   was   to   go   into   Norfolk   ye   week   I   left   London . I   expect   to   hear   of   him   to   day ,   or   shall   grow   jealous of   Mrs   Price ,   for   he   did   not   use   to   be   such   a   careless correspondent .   I   ask   pardon   for   sending   you   a   half   sheet of   paper   but   did   not   find   ye   other   part   had   been written   on   till   I   had   wrote   upon   ye     side   &   I   had not   time   to   begin   another   letter .   Mr   Montagu   desires   his Compts .   Please   to   direct   to   me   at   ye   post   office at   Newcastle   upon   Tyne . I   am   Dear   Sir Your   most   affectionate and   Obliged   Hble   Sevt . E Montagu

My   best   &   Dearest   friend I   have   had   a   safe   journey   hither   &   if I   had   had   your   company   I   shd   have   added   a   pleasant   one considering   ye   season   of   ye   year .

I   beg   my   Dearest   to   take   care   of   his   health which   is   far   more   precious   to   me   than   any   thing   in   this World .   For   ye   present   I   must   conclude   but   on   Saturday   shall write   you   a   longer   letter . I   am   my   Dear   with   the   highest   esteem &   most   gratefull   affection Yr   most   faithfull   Wife E M 
BC_1758_EMONTAGU_ED_2	Saturday   My   Dearest I   am   infinitely   obliged   to   you   for   yr kind   concern   for   my   little   nephew ,   thank   God   he   is well   after   this   severe   bout ,   a   little   weak   but   full   of spirit   &   play .   I   propose   to   call   on   Morris   tomorrow &   will   shew   him   yr   very   friendly   letter   which   I   am sure   will   give   him   great   pleasure ,   his   sincere   esteem &   regard   for   you   will   make   him   feel   ye   highest satisfaction   in   the   brotherly   affection   with   which you   express   yr   self   not   that   he   is   now   to   learn your   goodness   to   him   of   which   he   has   had   many proofs .   I   made   a   visit   to   Mr   Charles   Montagu to   day ,   his   legs   are   terribly   swelled ,   they   have   been scarified   by   which   he   finds   a   temporary   relief . Lord   Edgecumbe   is   dead .   Mr   C:   Montagu   &   Mr Archer   charged   me   with   many   compliments to   you .   poor   Mrs   Montagu   seems   very   unhappy The   tears   were   often   in   her   eyes ,   the   sight   of   her made   me   melancholly ;   to   see   a   beloved   object   in such   circumstances   is   woe   indeed ,   I   do   not   wonder she   is   so   much   affected .   I   am   sorry   I   express d   myself strongly   in   regard   to   my   health ,   I   did   not   mean I   was   worse   than   when   I   left   ye   Country .   I   am indeed   much   better ,   my   rest   is   good   &   I   have now   been   very   well   for     days ,   it   is   some   months   since I   had   had     hours   of   so   comfortable   health .   I   took a   long   airing   yesterday ,   to   day   I   made   some   necessary visits .   I   seldom   venture   out   in   ye   evening   tomorrow night   I   shall   go   to   Lady   F   Williams   &   must wait   on   Mrs   Bowes   &   Lady   F:   Burgoigne   who made   me   a   visit   some   days   ago .   Mr   Pitt   spoke   very well   at   ye   opening   of   ye   Parlmt .   the   K-   is much   pleased   with   ye   turn   of   ye   speech , &   ye   publick   from   him   does   not   find   fault . Tho   it   was   declaring   strongly   for   what   used to   be   calld   German   measures ,   however   we had   better   make   war   with   spirit   than   by halves .   Stillingfleet   &   Torriano   spent   ye   evening with   me   &   desired   their   compts   they   are but   just   gone   &   ye   last   bell   is   ringing   so I   can   only   add   that   I   am   with   most   true regard your   faithfull   affectionate and   Obedt   Wife E M My   voice   is   quite   well 
BC_1758_EMONTAGU_ED_3	My   Dearest I   am   glad   to   find   that   your   infinite labour   &   diligence   &   most   unwearied   application   is likely   to   be   answer'd   by   two   such   material   points as   ye   purchases .   I   grieve   at   the   disappointments &   delays   you   meet   with ,   which   would   indeed so   far   disgust   most   men   that   every   thing   would go   at   sixes   &   Sevens .   Your   prudence   &   dexterity both   in   ye   whole   affair   of   this   inheritance have   been   tried   &   proved .   Mr   Archdeacon   is weak   enough   to   think   he   shall   carry   his points   by   being   unreasonable ,   but   it   cannot be   supposed   that   a   commission   will   enter into   his   views   &   you   &   Mr   Isaacson   will   chuse such   commissioners   as   he   &   Lowes   cannot   impose upon .   I   am   glad   you   have   again   got   your   writings in   your   own   hands .   I   should   suppose   Mr   Arch- would   not   easily   quit   his   situation   but   how   far his   engagements   with   L-s   may   have   drawn him   into   inconvenience .   My   Father   who   I   was with   this   morning   assures   me   he   has   orderd Mr   Garker   to   charge   his   Tenants   to   ask   for Sir   Thos   Clavering .   Lord   Oxford   &   Ld   Bruce   are   made Lords   of   ye   Bed   chamber   Norbonne   Berkely   groom of   the   Bed   chamber .   My   Brother   &   Mrs   Robinson are   here   &   desire   their   most   affectionate   compts   to you .   They   are   here   so   I   can   only   add I   am   my   Dearest Ever   yrs E M 
BC_1758_EMONTAGU_GL_1	Darlington   ye     of   august   OR   My   Lord I   am   set   down   to   obey   your   Lordships kind   commands   to   let   you   know   how   I   perform'd   my   northern expedition .   I   am   now   about     miles   short   of   Newcastle   but if   I   defer   writing   till   I   get   thither   I   shall   lose   a   post   & by   that   means   my   letter   will   not   get   to   Hampton   Court   while your   Lordship   is   there .   I   have   travell'd   above     miles   since last   tuesday ,   &   am   better   to   night   than   I   was   when   I left   London ,   so   I   will   no   longer   endure   that   Dr   Monsey   shall call   me   flimsey   animal ,   puny   insect ,   &   other   such opprobrious   names .   I   begin   to   have   a   great   respect   for   my constitution ,   for   it   has   perform'd   this   journey   without the   usual   refreshment   of   sleep ,   &   yet   I   am   not   worn   out or   low   in   spirits .   The   Coachman   assured   us   this   morning our   own   set   of   Horses   would   bring   the   Coach   from   the place   we   lay   at   last   night   to   Darlington ,   which   is   measured   miles   &   we   have   perform'd   it ,   so   that we   shall   get   early   to   Newcastle   to   morrow .   We   have   had a   rough   journey   but   through   a   fine   Country ,   we   passd at   noon   within   a   few   miles   of   our   own   house   but did   not   retard   our   progress   to   visit   it ,   indeed   it   has no   inviting   charms ,   is   a   bad   habitation   situated on   a   flat ,   without   any   beauty   but   fine   verdure &   the   River   Swale .   At   present   we   are   within   three miles   of   an   estate   of   Mr   Montagu's   on   the   River   Tees which   is   very   beautifull .   I   have   had   such   a   surfeit of   being   in   a   post   chaise   that   I   have   not   made made   many   excursions   to   see   the   fine   places   that lay   in   the   road .   In   my   way   to   Nottingham   I   went to   see   Sr   Robert   Cliftons ,   which   appears   to   me   for beauty   of   prospect   equal   to   any   place   I   ever   saw , your   are   led   to   it   from   the   Turnpike   road   by   a   fine terrass   on   the   side   of   the   Trent ,   from   a   Pavillion   in the   garden   you   see   the   Town   &   Castle   of   Nottingham the   most   smiling   valley   imaginable   in   which   the Trent   serpentizes   in   a   most   beautifull   manner ,   & an   extensive   view   over   a   rich   Country .   The   Town   of Nottingham   resembles   Windsor ,   &   the   Country   about it   has   the   same   character ,   but   the   Trent   at   Sr R:   Cliftons   is   finer   than   the   Thames   at   Windsor . The   unhappy   master   of   this   fine   place   is   a   Prisoner within   the   liberties   of   the   Fleet ,   where   he   has   leisure to   repent   the   vices   &   follies   by   which   he   has   squanderd an   estate   of   L   a   year   &   mortgaged   his   House . I   return   your   Lordship   many   thanks   for   having lent   me   so   agreable   a   companion   as   Antonio   de   Solis whom   I   infinitely   respect   for   ye   solidity   of   his genius .   By   the   simplicity   of   his   narrations ,   the dignity   of   his   Speeches ,   &   ye   good   sense   of   his   reflections he   has   put   himself   in   the   rank   of   Thucydides &   Tacitus ,   by   writing   a   story   which   by   the   managmt of   a   Man   of   less   judgment   was   in   danger   of placing   its   author   on   ye   shelf   with   Scudery   & the   writers   of   Romance .   It   is   lamentable   to   see a   Man   of   his   discernment   in   other   matters   so blind   in   the   great   concern   of   religion .   He   exults in   the   triumph   over   Idolatry   when   Cortez   demolishes an   Idol   to   place   ye   Image   of   ye   Virgin   Mary In   its   place .   I   agree   with   him   so   far   as   to   imagine there   was   some   supernatural   assistance   given   to the   Spaniards   in   this   enterprize ,   &   the   character of   Cortez   is   not   among   the   ordinary   productions of   nature ,   but   composed   of   those   various   &   contrary qualities   that   are   requisite   to   bring   about   great events .   Daring   courage   &   consummate   prudence , a   character   of   frankness   &   magnanimity ,   with occasional   dissimulation   &   artifice ,   &   all   these   in   the highest   degree   make   a   most   rare   &   uncommon   composition , &   I   am   apt   to   look   on   these   extraordinary   persons as   inspired .   I   think   Cortez   equal   in   courage   to   Alexander It   is   easy   to   find   valour   for   a   days   occasion ,   &   vigilance for   a   short   danger ,   but   to   live   with   a   few   friends in   a   vast   &   populous   Country   of   enemies   for   so   long a   time ,   where   labour   was   never   crown d   with   rest , nor   victory   with   security ,   seems   to   me   the   most formidable   of   all   undertakings .   When   he   takes Montezuma   Prisoner   I   am   as   much   amazed   as his   Mexican   Majesty ,   the   arguments   the   Historian makes   him   use   to   prevail   on   Montezuma   to   surrender   himself are   admirably   fitted   to   an   Imperial   ear . he   respects   nothing   in   the   Emperor   but   his   vain pride   &   love   of   a   respectfull   address .   &   it   seems   he understood   the   monarch ,   who   could   endure   the   loss of   liberty   better   than   an   omission   of   ceremony .   Forms of   respects   were   establishd   to   guard   prerogatives , but   I   know   not   why ,   they   soon   grew   dearer   to   those accustomed   to   them   than   the   very   rights   they   were invented   to   protect .   I   cannot   help   thinking   the Belle   Marine   the   happiest   Woman   that   ever Existed ,   she   seem'd   to   have   match d   herself   with a   superior   species ,   &   I     figure   to   myself how   her   heart   must   exult   when   she   saw   her Consort   ( for   I   suppose   she   lookd   on   her   connection with   Cortez   as   a   marriage )   leading   Captive   that Monarch ,   whom   none   of   her   fellow   subject   durst look   in   the   face .   I   am   anxious   to   know   what   becomes of   the   fair   one   when   Cortez   has   no   longer   occasion for   her   as   an   Interpreter .   I   have   but   just   finishd   the first   volume   for   much   of   the   road   has   been   too   rough to   allow   me   to   read ,   &   at   the   Inns   I   generally   write letters ,   &   I   fear   your   Lordship   by   this   time   thinks   very long   ones ,   but   I   could   not   help   telling   you   how   much your   book   has   contributed   to   my   amusement   in this   long   journey .   You   will   excuse   all   the   absurdities I   may   have   express d ,   &   ye   vile   scrawl   in   which   they are   written ,   for   neither   my   head   or   hand   are   very steady   after   so   long   a   journey .   I   know   your aversion   to   writing   letters ,   but   hope   you   will   let me   hear   you   got   safe   into   the   Country . I   am Your   Lordships Most   Obliged and   faithfull   Hble   Servt E M 
BC_1758_EMONTAGU_GL_2	"My   Lord I   have   this   moment   received   your   Lordships most   kind   &   friendly   congratulations   on   my   late   recovery , &   tho   the   post   is   just   setting   out   I   cannot   help   returning you   immediate   the   imperfect   thanks   for   your   goodness to   me .   Nothing   can   give   this   life   so   high   a   price   as to   find   such   as   Lord   Lyttelton   interest   themselves   in   ones preservation   .   As   to   my   fainting   fits   they   are   not   alarming , being   what   I   was   used   to   from   infancy ,   &   had   more   frequently when   I   had   stronger   health .   I   have   great   confidence   that this   accident   will   be   of   service   to   me ,   my   Newcastle Doctor   is   one   of   ye   best   physicians   in   England   of   great note   &   eminence   in   this   part   of   ye   World ,   &   to   a   remarkable genius   has   joind   great   practise   &   experience ,   &   is   infinitely carefull   of   his   patients ,   so   that   of   Human   help   I   have ye   best   that   can   be ,   but   my   reliance   is   on   that   Providence that   has   so   miraculously   preserved   me ,   not   for   my   own sake   but   for   the   worthy   friends   who   interest   themselves for   me ,   &   of   whose   care   may   that   Providence   make   me worthy !   This   accident   has   shewn   me   how   dear   I   am   to   my Friends   whose   letters   have   express d   more   regard   than I   can   merit .   I   dined   with   some   company   we   had   yesterday &   was   not   fatigued   by   it ,   but   I   make   no   visits   nor receive   any   of   mere   form ,   for   my   Doctor   is   very   carefull , &   in   ye   Northern   phrase   "" says ""   he   wont   have   me   harrassd &   fatigued   for   trifles   &   babbles ,   &   he   has   told   all   my   neighbors I   can   neither   visit   nor   be   visited .

BC_1758_EMONTAGU_SS_1	Denton     of   Sept: As   I   can   tell   my   Dear   Sister   I   am   now very   well ,   I   hope   it   will   give   her   little   pain   to   know I   have   been   very   ill ,   especially   as   that   illness   past   may occasion   health   to   come   as   I   have   a   weakness   in   my left   eye   I   must   be   brief .   On   this   day   sennight   at   in   ye   Morn   I   was   seiz'd   with   a   fainting   fit ,   in   which I   lay   sometime   my   Maids   in   their   fright   let   ye   Eau   de luce   fall   into   my   eye   nostril   &   mouth ,   my   eyes   was   enflamed &   nostril ,   but   ye   Mouth   &   Uvula   of   ye   throat   excoriated After   a   long   hard   &   cruel   struggle   for   life   a   most sharp   contention   with   this   medicine   I   awakend   to   find myself   in   this   terrible   condition .   Dr   Askew   un happily lay   at   Durham   that   night   so   had   no   assistance till     at   noon ,   then   I   was   blooded   which   abated   ye inflammation   so   far   I   cd   articulate .   ye   Dr   told   me   my safety   depended   on   frequent   gurgling   &   drinking   so   for   days   I   was   never     of   an   hour   without   so   doing   ye Spitting   was   more   ardent   than   from   a   Mercureal salivation   &   I   believe   will   be   beneficial   to   my   health I   am   now   pure   well ,   rested   well   last   night   &   after   great   & cruel   sufferings   taste   ye   joy   of   ease .   It   was   a   formidable   moment when   I   came   out   of   my   fit   to   see   blood   running   from   eye nose   &   mouth   Mr   Montagu   almost   distracted   &   I   knew not   which   way   my   agonies   wd   end .   God   in   his   mercy heard   me ,   &   has   indeed   refreshd   me   with   short   slumbers thro   my   illness ,   or   I   must   have   been   in   a   delirium .   I   beg my   Dear   Sister   &   Lady   Bab   to   add   their   thanksgiving   prayers to   mine   for   this   great   deliverance .   Dr   Askew   says   what has   happend   will   be   of   infinite   service   to   my   health that   I   have   a   sharp   scorbutick   habit   &   he   thinks I   may   be   better   after   this   than   I   have   been   of   many Years .   Mr   Montagu   has   shewn   on   this   occasion   ye   most passionate   love   imaginable .   Dr   Askew   has   been   very   carefull &   an   excellt   apothecary   has   watchd   me   night   &   day . I   ail   nothing   now   but   a   little   tenderness   of   mouth   &   eye ,   &   I   spit more   than   is   cleanly   still   by   tomorrow   that   too   will   be   over Ever   yrs   most   affectly .

Since   I   wrote to   you   I   was   attack d   by   a   disorder   in   my bowels   which   tho   it   went   off   with   a   short confinement   having   only   kept   my   room a   week   yet   it   alarm'd   me   as   it   began like   ye   epidemical   diarrhea   which   had carried   of   great   numbers   in   ye   Neighbourhood Mr   Montagu   was   so   frightend   he   desired I   wd   go   to   Town   as   soon   as   I   was   able to   travel ,   indeed   it   is   time   I   shd   be   in Winter   quarters   for   the   hoarseness which   was   occasiond   by   ye   eau   de luce   is   very   bad   a   cold   or   damp   day affects   my   voice   extreamly   &   I   have A   troublesome   cough   in   other   respects   I am   very   well .   Mr   Montagu   politely   accompanied me     days   journey ,   but   his   business   not being   all   done   he   returnd   this   morning We   lay   at   Ferry   Bridge   last   night .   I left   ye   Post   chaise   at   Carr   ville   that he   might   have   it   to   travell   to   Town   in ,   so I   am   in   ye   body   Coach ,   but   my   horses are   so   stout   I   believe   they   will   perform ye   journey   from   Carrville   to   London   in   days .   Mr   Tom   Pitt   nephew   to   Miss   Pitt with   a   young   Gentleman   a   friend   of   his calld   to   make   me   a   visit   at   Carr   ville a   few   days   before   I   was   to   set   out   for London ,   they   left   us   ye   day   before   we were   to   depart ,   but   as   they   staid   to see   the   Cathedral   at   Durham   & c We   met   at   ye   Inn   ye   first   night They   intimated   they   wishd   we   wd   send our   Maids   into   their   post   chaise   & take   them   into   ye   Coach   which   we   did , and   we   are   now   going   on   in   the   same fashion   but   as   Mr   Montagu   has   now left   us   I   have   taken   ye   fair   Susan into   ye   Coach ,   which   I   fancy   my   young Men   do   not   much   dislike   as   she   is a   good   object   for   a   vis   a   vis   .   My   Gentlemen leave   me   at   Stilton   from   whence   they go   to   Cambridge .   Pray   have   you   seen any   thing   of   Miss   Mary   Pitt .   How   Mrs Ann   in   her   health ?   Is   she   to   return   to Leicester   house   or   stay   at   Bath .   You may   believe   I   am   glad   I   am   so   far   of my   journey   to   Town   tho   I   shall   be   distressd there   for   want   of   an   housekeeper   &   also of   Clarke   whom   I   left   at   Carrville   to attend   Mr   Montagu   to   whom   he   is   very usefull   in   many   respects ,   particularly in   looking   after   ye   furniture   of   Mr Rogers   house   in   Newcastle   which   is now   to   be   divided .   Mr   Montagu   has   purchased all   ye   Jewels   for   me ,   &   to   day   intimated he   shd   give   me   a   great   purse   of   old gold   which   fell   to   his   share   in   division some   of   ye   peices   are   curious   but there   will   be   between     &   L   of   money that   one   may   spend   with   a   good conscience .   I   am   afraid   you   will   think I   have   been   very   idle ,   as   a   correspondent of   late   but   I   had   so   many   things   to do   before   my   setting   forward   &   was   for some   time   so   ill   I   cd   not   write .   My   best   respects attend   Lady   Bab.   I   rejoyce   you   are   well   enough   to   go to   make   visits .   I   cannot   believe ,   why   the   report   concerning Mrs   P   &   Mr   A- .   it   is   surely   impossible .   but   a   rich   Widow cannot   speak   to   a   man   but   ye   World   marries   her   to   him .

I   assure   you   if   my   workfolks   are   to   be   paid as   you   mention   they   will   be   distinguishd from   the   rest   of   the   Country   by   their   embonpoint , &   so   far   will   even   the   strictest   application be   from   working   their   fingers   to   the   bone , that   their   fingers   will   grow   the   more   fleshy for   it .   pray   let   Mrs   Patello   have   more   profit &   we   will   be   satisfied   with   less   pay   for   as   you Observe   the   great   matter   is   to   have   constant employmt .   As   to   Mr   Scott   I   have   curiously   enquired after   his   situation   &   I   believe   he   is   not   just   now in   any   employment ,   but   he   is   to   be   a   Commissioner of   excise   the   first   vacancy .   I   did   not   care to   say   any   thing   of   him   till   he   was   again in   place   least   it   shd   give   you   any   anxiety but   he   is   certainly   to   be   provided   for   immediately &   ( probably )   has   a   present   pension .   I   am very   uneasy   about   Mrs   Sawbridge   why   does not   she   come   to   Town   to   her   Sisters   where   she wd   have   all   the   accommodation   in   her   power &   might   have   the   best   advice ,   for   really   her not   being   perfectly   well   is   very   alarming   as such   a   state   must   prevent   her   taking   exercise &   all   the   means   of   health .   I   wish   she   wd   make Mr   Ford   write   the   whole   of   ye   case   to   her Sister   who   wd   consult   Dr   Shaw   &   whoever they   thought   proper .   I   beg   you   to   make   her   consider of   all   this   &   as   soon   as   the   weather   is   milder   the Properest   safest   thing   is   that   she   come   to   London &   you   know   her   Sister   will   be   more   glad   to   see her   &   enjoy   her   company   by   her   fireside   than   can be   expressd .   I   am   just   returnd   from   Sr   Sidney   Smiths in   Bloomsbury   Square ,   I   had   yr   letter   just   before I   set   out   so   cd   not   sit   down   to   answer   it &   the   second   bell   was   ringing   as   I   came   home so   till   next   post   adieu   My   Dearest   Sister Ever   yrs I   am   in   perfect   health . you   shall   soon   have   more work   better   pack'd .

BC_1759_EMONTAGU_EC_1	Hillstreet   ye     of   june Dear   Madm Send   me   a   better   letter ,   yes ,   I   say   a   better   letter , do   you   think   I   care   for   your   wit   &   your   wisedom   when you   won't   tell   me   how   you   do .   Direct   your   next   to Madme   Sevigné   in   ye   shades ,   or   to   Madme   Maintenons Spirit   in   ye   cloysters   of   St   Cyr ,   they   will   admire your   language ,   they   will   approve   your   sentiments , &   being   no   longer   of   Earths   mould   will   feel   none of   ye   fears ,   the   cares ,   that   haunt   a   mortal   Woman for   a   mortal   friend .   What   aggravates   your   quill is   that   I   do   suppose   you   are   very   well   &   would not   tell   me   so .   The   state   of   your   body   may   be   well , but   for   the   state   of   your   mind   what   a   farrago of   vanity !   What   toys   what   bagatelles   must   it be   composed   of   that   you   take   such   delight   in the   pump   Room !   I   suppose   by   this   time   you   are famous   there   for   ye   fluency   of   your   small   talk , the   pertness   of   your   repartee ,   &   the   flippancy   of   your dialogue ,   nay   for   what   I   know   you   may   shine in   equivoque   &   double   entendre .   I   am   glad   Miss   Talbot Recovers recovers   so   fast .   I   was   always   of   opinion   that   ye   conversation of   a   reasonable ,   tender ,   sensible   friend   for   her   sick hours ,   &   an   ingenious   learned   companion   for   her   better spirits ,   might   have   been   of   great   service   to   her :   so   great was   my   zeal   for   her   I   wish'd   her   such   a   Person   as could   give   dignity   to   the   sentiments   of   Epictetus   & write   an   introduction   to   the   work   far   better   than all   the   productions   of   pagan   wisedom :   but   in   this strange   World   one   is   apt   to   take   things   too   high . Miss   Betsy   Carter   gay   from   a   Ball ,   &   flippant   from ye   Pump   room   does   just   as   well .   I   shall   take   my   next measures   several   degrees   below   ye   sublime ,   then   I may     be   on   a   level   with   experience which   ye   choice   spirits   &   sublimated   genius's seldom   are . I   am   glad   you   were   enough   in   your   sober   senses   to like   my   friend   Mrs   Pitt .   I   could   not   help   fancying I   saw   you   sitting   by   her   in   ye   Window   coughing , hemming ,   sneezing ,   &   giving   every   sign   of   life   but speaking .   I   do   not   wonder   you   found   yr   self   so easy   in   ye   visit ,   ex tream treme   politeness   comes   nearest to   ex tream treme   simplicity   of   manners ;   &   indeed   does not   ye   utmost   limits   of   improvement   in   every   thing bring   people   near   to   where   they   set   out ?   I   am   not satisfied   with   ye   account   of   Mrs   Pitts   health :   don't do   not   let Her   drink   too   much   Bristol   water ,   there   is   no   spring but   that   which   you   &   nine   other   Virgins   drink   at , of   which   the   deeper   the   draught   the   safer   the experiment .   If   you   have   not   forgot   your   abc   you   may read   Mr   Masons   Caractacus .   It   is   a   Drama   not   Dramatical ; his   Melpomene   is   too   chaste   &   too   cold   for   ye   Theater Theatre . She   is   a   very   modest   Virgin ,   pure   in   sentiment   &   diction   & void   of   passion ;   her   sober   ornaments   are   a   Greek   veil   & some   Druidical   Hieroglyphicks ,   all   which   I   mightily respect   &   do   not   at   all   like .   I   do   not   mean   to   say   the peice   has   not   merit ,   it   has   a   great   deal ,   but   on   the whole   I   must   own   I   am   not   fond   of   such   compositions . I   believe   indeed   they   are   designd   for   my   betters   in learning   &   taste .   I   rejoyce   that   yr   Brother   is   at Bristol .   Pray   make   my   best   compts   to   Mrs   &   Miss   Talbot &   Mrs   Pitt ,   &   also   to   yr   Brother ,   why   was   he   not   so good   as   to   call   upon   me ?   I   could   have   talk d   of   you , &   it   is   a   subject   that   I   believe   I   talk   well   upon ,   for   my heart   is   as   eloquent   as   any   ones .   I   hope   you   will write   to   me   soon ,   &   pray   tell   me   whether   you   like pompons   or   aigrettes   in   yr   hair ,   if   you   put   on   rouge , dance   minuets   &   Cottillons   that   I   may   describe   & define   you   in   yr   Bristol   state .   I   ask   a   thousand pardons   for   detaining   you   so   long   from   ye   pump   room but   I   hope   it   will   make   you   some   amends   if   I   tell you   Ld   Northampton   had   a   fine   suit   for   ye   Birth   day The   wastecoat   silver   &   gold ,   ye   coat   gold   &   silver .   These   must be   interesting   subjects   to   a   Bristol   Belle .   I   am   glad   I   have got   a   recipe   from   ye   Druids   to   exorcise   &   purify   you   when   you   leave   Bristol . I   must   sprinkle   you   with   Druid   holy   water ,   I   must   dash some   boughs   of   vervain   blue dipt   in   cold   September   dew   full   in   your   face   &   you will   read   Plato   again   with   yr   wonted   sobriety ,   in   the mean   time   in   hopes   of   better   days I   am yr   most   faithfull and   affecte   & c & c E Montagu 
BC_1759_EMONTAGU_EC_2	Sandleford   near   Newbury   Berks ye     of   july My   Dear   Friend Will   your   head   never   be   cured   of   those   painfull diseases   thinking   &   aching ?   Cannot   the   long   room   remove the   first   of   these   maladies   &   the   pump   the   second ?   Alass   no ! Our   perfections   &   imperfections   are   more   intimately   united &   more   closely   woven   into   our   frame   than   we   are   apt   to imagine .   The   destinies   dye   the   wool   before   they   spin   our thread ;   they   use   none   but   grain   colours   &   sun   wind   &   rain &   the   force   of   external   accidents   operate   but   little .   Hypatia would   have   been   a   Philosopher   &   Sappho   a   wit   tho   they   had been   educated   at   a   french   boarding   school   at   Chelsea   or   Kensington   &   Helen a   -   in   the   college   of   Vestals .   You   was   destined   to   have wisedom   &   the   head   ach   &   all   the   folly   of   the   multitude &   the   knowledge   of   Physicians   cannot   prevent   it   .   perhaps on   the   delicacy   of   the   same   fine   nerve   depends   your   acute reasoning   &   acute   pain .   These   opiniatre   spinsters   have   so tinctured   my   opinions   that   I   envy   you   one   half   the   day &   pitty   you   the   other   half ;   &   whether   you   wind   my   worsted round   the   groves   at   Sandleford ,   or   fasten   it   to   a   chinese chair   in   Hillstreet ,   it   cannot   be   alter'd   a   shade   in   either of   these   respects .   I   shall   love ,   admire ,   &   pitty   you   wherever I   am ,   &   should   tell   you   so   oftener   if   I   were   not   afraid   to   sollicit your   correspondence   when   this   grievous   head   ach   might make   it   painfull   &   hurtfull   to   you .   I   flatter   myself That   you   would   not   leave   Bristol   without   intimating   to me   how   &   where   I   might   see   you .   I   am   now   most   happily situated   to   catch   an   interview .   Sandleford   is   but   little   more than   a   mile   from   Newbury ,   &   I   hope   you   will   use   your interest   with   Mrs   Talbot   &   Miss   Talbot   to   make   this   their Inn .   I   will   undertake   to   give   them   beds   well   aired   &   more quiet   than   at   the   Pelican   or   new   Inn :   but   what   is   to   them the   strongest   invitation   is   the   happiness   they   would   give   me by   such   a   visit .   If   I   could   perswade   my   Dear   Miss   Carter to   stay   here   with   me   how   happy   should   I   think   myself ! but   do   not   be   afraid   of   coming   hither   least   I   should   urge this   with   too   much   importunity ,   for   favours   to   my   self   I have   some   modesty   in   asking .   I   am   at   present   very   happy in   the   hopes   of   seeing   Mrs   Pitt ,   I   expect   her   here   to   morrow or   next   day ,   you   know   her   so   well   I   need   not   say   much to   convince   you   of   my   joy   on   such   an   opportunity   of   enjoying her   conversation ,   &   I   imagine   she   will   now   like   me   as the   friend   of   Miss   Carter .   All   her   letters   express'd   the highest   pleasure   in   your   acquaintance   so   I   have   made two   people   who   are   fam'd   to   make   every   one   so . Mr   Montagu   was   detain'd   in   Town   by   various affairs   &   accidents   till   thursday   last .   My   joy   at   being   at last   released   from   the   heat   &   hurry   of   London   was entirely   overcast   by   the   death   of   Lady   Essex .   the   sense   of Lady   Frances   Williams   affliction   sat   heavy   on   my mind ,   the   news   of   it   was   brought   me   just   as   I   was setting   out ,   &   it   spoil'd   my   partaking   of   this   general joy   diffused   so   bountifully   thro   the   whole   creation   in a   fine   summers   day :   a   fever   added   to   the   maladies   of a   lying   in   hurried   off   Lady   Essex   in   three   days .   The   fondness of   a   Mother   &   the   opinions   of   a   christian   were   all shocked   at   the   rapidity   of   this   accident ,   which   hurried this   gay   young   creature   out   of   the   World   in   all   the jollity   of   her   may   day   morning .   In   vain   had   education endeavour'd   to   give   her   a   solidity   of   character she   was   carry'd   by   the   force   of   fashion   down   the   stream of   pleasure   fast   &   far .   As   her   faults   were   these   that arise   from   levity   not   wickedness ,   one   had   hopes   she would   in   time   grow   more   prudent   &   despise   those follies   she   had   caught   by   the   infection   of   the   World . I   have   bad   accounts   of   Lady   Frances   health ,   &   much fear   the   weight   of   this   affliction ,   &   the   rapidity   with which   it   came ,   will   overwhelm   her .   she   has   indeed   the best   support   a   firm   &   rational   piety ,   but   her   heart doated   on   this   daughter . I   am   glad   you   agree   with   me   in   destestation   of   Voltaires Optimisme .   Are   not   you   provoked   that   such   an   animal calls   itself   a   Philosopher ?   what   pretence   can   he   have to   Philosophy   who   has   not   that   fear   of   God   which is   the   beginning   of   wisedom ?   This   creature   is   a   downright rebel   to   his   God .   some   good   may   arise   indeed   from the   division   of   Satans   household ,   Voltaire   directly opposed   Ld   Bolingbroke   &   those   who     affirm   whatever is   is   right ,   &   that   there   wants   not   a   future   state   to make   ye   system   just .   Lord   what   is   Man   that   he   shall reject   ye   offer   of   another   World   or   the   enjoyment   of   this as   pleases   his   humour   &   serves   his   book . I   rejoyce   that   Miss   Talbot   is   so   recoverd ,   but   let   her health   be   ever   so   perfect   I   should   be   more   afraid   of   the strength   of   her   arguments   than   her   voice .   I   am   glad I   shall   have   your   Brother   on   my   side ,   it   is   luckily lucky   for me   &   my   cause . Pray   do   me   the   favour   to   present   my   compts   to   all our   friends .   I   depend   on   yr   Brothers   being   of   yr   party to   Sandleford   or   that   he   calls   on   me   whenever   he passes .   I   wd   have   waited   on   yr   Sister   if   you   had intimated   where   I   could   have   found   her .   I   shall   impatiently long   to   know   when   you   come   this   way ,   I   could   live   on the   hope   of   the   interview   for   a   Week ,   so   give   me   early notice .   With   ye   most   sincere   &   tender   affection I   am   Dear   Madam yours   & c E Montagu 
BC_1759_EMONTAGU_EC_3	"I   am   much   obliged   to   my   Dear Miss   Carter   for   her   kind   compliance   with   my   request   to let   me   hear   from   her .   When   requests   are   not   founded   in   deserts , one   fears   for   the   success   of   them ,   &   I   was   conscious   I   did   not merit   such   an   indulgence .   I   almost   wish   I   could   read   with more   confidence   your   modest   renunciation   of   perfection .   I   wish I   could   be   sure   you   stood   in   need   of   some   indulgence   sometimes . I   could   then   enter   into   an   alliance   with   you   of   the   stricter kind ;   I   was   born   faulty ,   feeble ,   apt   to   offend ,   &   ready   to   forgive . I   am   indulgent ,   ready   made   to   your   hand ;   your   conversation &   even   example   will   never   make   me   perfect   so   Dear   Madam if   you   have   any   fauts faults ,   keep   them   for   me ;   let   them be   part   of   our   treaty ,   &   preserve   yr   unallay d   perfections for   these   high   Potentates   dans   la   morale   who   have no   weaknesses .   Adamant   is   finer   than   diamond ,   but it   is   fit   only   to   make   palaces   in   the   sky .   We   have   no tools   that   will   work   upon   it .   If   one   could   find   absolute perfection   in   a   human   creature   one   could   never   shape it   into   a   friend ;   our   weaknesses   are   penetrable ,   wisedom unallay'd   is   of   a   great   resistance ,   it   must   be   incorporated with   a   softer   metal   before   it   will   take   an   impression . Let   ye   Virtuosi   lock   up   in   their   cabinets   the   stubborn Oar ,   but   give   me   the   gold   &   the   merit   that   is   brought to   the   standard   of   use .   I   am   a   little   fearfull   that   what you   calls   faults   in   yourself   I   have   call'd   virtues when   I   have   found   them   in   my   own   mind ;   particularly when   you   accuse   your   self   of   a   wild   &   untractable   love of   liberty ,   because   you   want   a   place   where   you   can Enjoy   some   hours   every   day   uninterrupted .   This   is   my own   turn ,   &   I   thought   it   an   excellence ,   a   perfection   & almost   a   virtue ,   I   have   sometimes   in   an   humble   hour ,   or rather   in   a   complaisant   one ,   ask'd   pardon   for   it   of my   friends ,   &   own'd   my   nature   had   something   favou in   it ,   which   the   usage   of   the   world   had   not   tamed   ,   but seriously   speaking   how   neccessary   to   health   &   virtue too ,   is   repose   &   reflection ?   as   much   as   I   wish   to   see   you I   would   not   desire   it   on   any   terms   that   should   lay   you under   such   constraint   as   you   would   feel   if   you   had not   a   home ,   shall   a   free   thinker   &   a   witling   have a   House   &   she   no   House   at   all ?   indeed   my   Dear   Madam I   should   be   unhappy   if   I   thought   a   mind   like   Miss Carters ,   which   must   reckon   meditation   &   reflection among   its   duties ,   was   continually   whirled   about in   the   vain   tracasserie   of   ye   idly   busy   world ,   but   I   am sure   I   could   find   you   in   this   part   of   ye   Town ,   in   ye environs   of   Hillstreet ,   a   neat   lodging   on   reasonable terms ,   you   wd   want   only   a   room   to   receive   yr   company , another   to   sleep   in ,   &   in   ye   upper   regions   one   for   yr maid ;   when   you   was   well   &   it   was   convenient   you might   ( I   am   a   little   modest   just   now )   but   what   good things   does   poor   modesty   get   in   this   World ?   so   to   be impudent   I   proceed   you   might   dine   with   me .   When you   chose   to   dine   at   home   which   must   often   be   more convenient   to   you ,   I   send   you   a   boild   chicken   in   the heated   element   in   which   it   was   dress'd ,   or   a   Roast rabbit   with   a   cover   on   ye   dish   &   an   envellope   of Napkins   on   that   &   thus   we   get   rid   of   ye   trouble of   a   Cook   &   a   kitchen ,   hiring   a   stranger   for   ye time   or   having   the   trouble   of   bringing   one   up . I   never   use   a   Coach   in   ye   afternoon ,   in   the   morning I   could   carry   you   wherever   you   please ,   in   ye   evening you   carry   ye   Coach   wherever   you   please .   I   am   afraid you   will   be   ready   to   answer   pray   Mrs   Montagu   what right   have   you   to   expect   I   should   oblige   &   please you   two   or   three   times   a   day ?   To   which   I   honestly answer   I   have   not ,   but   is   not   friendship   a   Covenant ? are   you   afraid   of   staking   first   Miss   Carter ?   Is   that the   generous   &   good   Miss   Carter !   In   the   intercourse one   must   oblige   first ,   why   should   not   you   begin ?   I will   try   to   convince   you   I   am   not   ungratefull , if   you   are   afraid   to   trust   me   I   won't   be   angry   but I   shall   be   very   sorry .   I   shall   not   allow   you   to   use the   vulgar   phrase   "" trouble   you   for   a   Coach ""   take "" such   a   favour ""   words   which   unkind   reserve   may use   to   a   suspected   or   unmeaning   offers .   you   &   I   will   know   very   well where   the   obligation   will   lie ,   if   you   know   in   how superior   a   light   I   see   you   you   will   be   assured that   I   should   not   have   ask d   you   to   receive   a favour   tho   I   ask   you   to   do   one . There   is   a   letter   from   Rousseau   to   Mr   D'Alembert upon   ye   project   of   settling   a   Theatre   at   Geneva which   treats   of   Drammatical   performances   in general :   which it   is   ingeniously   written   &   with great   eloquence .   The   author   wrote   before   to   prove   the savage   state   preferable   to   civil   society .   he He   is a   stranger   to   ye   sweet   civilities   of   life ;   whatever is   gentle   he   thinks   weak ;   he   seems   to   have   principles of   justice   &   integrity ,   so   we   must   call   him   honest Bruin .   I   should   have   sent   you   that   &   Dr   Newtons dissertation   &   on   the   prophecies   if   I   had   not   waited for   the   sending   of   Lelands   life   of   Philip   of Macedon .   I   design   they   shd   should   all   come   down   to you   as   soon   as   I   can   get   ye   latter :   I   do   not   know whether   you   have   ye   first   vol:   of   Dr   Newton   but at   a   venture   wd   would have   sent   it   you ,   but   cd   could   not   get one ,   there   is   a   new   edition   of   it   in   ye   press   when finishd   you   shall   have   it   as   you   have   undoubtedly read   it   you   will   in   ye   mean   time   be   able to   follow   ye   thread   through   these   later   volumes . Lord   Lyttelton's   history   is   not   yet   ready   to   appear , ye   work   goes   on   slowly   as   ye   writer   is   scrupulously exact   in   following   truth .   his   delicacy   in   regard to   characters ,   his   candour   in   regard   to   opinions , his   precision   in   facts ,   would   entitle   him   to   the   best palm   history   can   claim ,   if   he   had   not   added   to these   virtues   of   history ,   if   I   may   call   them   so ,   the highest   ornaments   of   style ,   &   a   most   peculiar grace   of   order   &   method .   You   will   find   this   most unlike   to   modern   history ,   where   the   muses   of Memory   are   made   like   old   maids   to   scold   &   talk scandal   &   repeat   ye   lye   of   ye   day .   Lord   Lyttelton often   enquires   after   you   &   charged   me   to present   his   best   compts ;   he   was   flatterd   that   you enquired   after   his   Work .   he   is   indeed   writing   for you   &   such   as   you ,   but   most   readers   want   to find   history   a   smart   libel   on   former   times   & Persons .   I   shall   send   you   a   treatise   on   the   sublime and   beautiful   by   Mr   Burke   a   friend   of   mine . I   do   not   know   that   you   will   always   subscribe to   his   system ,   but   I   think   you   will   find   him an   elegant   &   ingenious   writer .   He   is   far   from   the pert   pedantry   &   assuming   ignorance   of   modern witlings ;   but   in   conversation   &   writing   an   ingenious &   ingenuous   man ;   modest   &   delicate ,   &   on   great &   serious   Subjects   full   of   that   respect   &   veneration   which a   good   mind   &   a   great   one   is   sure   to   feel ,   while fools   rush   behind   ye   altar   at   which   wise   men kneel   &   pay   mysterious   reverence .   As   you   have all   the   keys   that   unlock   ye   treasures   of   antiquity you   will   perhaps   despise   my   tribute   from   the press ,   but   Dr   Newtons   is   a   subject   will   interest   you &   I   believe   it   is   well   treated ,   at   least   I   thought   so in   his   first   book .   I   have   not   read   these .   Mr   Burkes   is a   method   of   analysizing ,   so   you   may   try   his   process on   yr   Grecian   friends .   Longinus   has   only   told   us what   is   sublime   & not   how   it   is   so ,   I   imagine   he   must be   a   charming   writer   in   his   native   greek ,   tho by   Boileaus   translation   I   think   what   Mr   Pope   says of   him   is   both   a   panegyrick   &   a   criticism ;   that He   is   himself   the   great   sublime   he   draws ,   is   a testimony   of   his   being   a   fine   writer ,   but   the attention   he   has   to   being   sublime ,   makes   him not   so   good   a   teacher   at   least   in   Boileau   it appeard   so   to   me .   How   is   it   that   Tully   makes   his   stile fit   equally   to   every   subject ?   the   precise   moralist the   discussing   philosophy philosopher   &   ye   angry   convert ,   &   never more   nicely   adapted   than   when   he   shifts   into   ye lame   &   slipper'd   pantaloon ,   &   relaxing   the   nerves of   stile   speaks   ye   language   of   ye   mitigated meliorated   happiness   of   mild   old   age .   I   hope   I   have by   this   last   panegyrick   attoned   a   little   for   my pertness   in   regard   to   Longinus   whom   the   french   has made   me   consider   as   a   Diseur   de   bons   mots   .   Don't be   angry !   brave   orts   indeed   as   Fluellen   says ,   but I   think   it   the   glory   of   ye   ancients   that   they seemd   to   write   to   the   purpose   &   not   to   applause . I   have   had   the   pleasure   of   seeing   Miss   Talbot twice ,   I   wish   I   could   give   a   perfect   good   account   of her   health   but   it   is   too   delicate :   and   I   expect   her great   tenderness   to   her   friends   makes   her   hide   little disorders   which   she   should   attend   to .   She   is   certainly much   better   &   I   hope   the   spring   will   entirely   restore her   health .   You   kindly   enquire after   mine ,   which   is better   worth   yr   notice   than   it   usually   is ,   thank God   I   have   been   extreamly extremely   well   of   late ,   except a   transient   cold   &   rheumatism .   My   voice   is   still in   the   Raven   key ,   my   throat   not   having   quite recoverd   ye   effects   of   eau   de   luce .   I   beg   you   wd   never let   it   approach   you   when   you   have   ye   head   ach The   great   affair   at   Lisbon   is   not   entirely   understood some   say   it   is   made   of   ye   dire   ingredients   of   criminal Love ,   ambition   of   Regal   power ,   &   popular   discontent , these   stirr'd   up   by   Jesuit   art ,   produced   assassination ; It   is   no   wonder   such   materials   in   ye   hands of   such   artists   should   form effect   the   ugliest   of   forms . I   shall   send   my   parcell   by   ye   Deal   Coach   as   soon as   ye   Bookseller   will   give   ye   great   Philip   a Coat .   I   hear   ye   work   commended   by   Persons   of   great judgment ;   I   should   think   it   difficult   for   a   mere speculative   Savant   to   enter   into   ye   depth   of Philips   policys   if If   Mr   Leland   is   a   good   journalist of   ye   Man ,   &   a   good   gazetteer   of   ye   times ,   which   I do   not   doubt   but   he   is   ,   he   may   give   one   entertainment , tho   he   should   not   be   of   ye   Cabinet   Council . May   health   be   of   your   mornings   walk   &   sit   down with   you   at   ye   fireside   in   an   evening ;   but   indeed Variety   &   dissipation   would   be   your   best   remedies ; you   will   think   I   prescribe   like   other   Doctors   for the   sake   of   the   fee ,   I   am   like   some   of   ye   honestest of   the   faculty ,   I   desire   health   for   you   and   the   fee for   myself ,   I   wish   both   earnestly ,   if   you   would have   me   better   you   must   come   &   teach   me . If   you   are   really   indolent   you   will   come   to   Town to   get   rid   of   such   a   troublesome   correspondent .   I   presume on   ye   length   of   the   evenings ,   &   sometimes   a   state   of health   which   will   not   allow   you   to   apply   to   things very   serious   or   very   lively ,   if   I   should   write   on   to   the bottom   of   the   second   sheet   you   will   think   I   do   it   out of   revenge   for   your   staying   in   the   Country   so   I   will take   my   leave   here ,   with   some   appearance   of   moderation &   with   much   real   esteem   &   affection   I   am   Dear   Madam your   most   Sincere   &   faithfull Friend   &   Obliged   &   Hble   Servt & c & c &  c E   Montagu "
BC_1759_EMONTAGU_EC_4	"ye   My   Dear   Miss   Carter Neither   philosopher   nor   pipkin   could behave   worse   to   you   than   I   have   done   of   late ,   but   I   assure you   I   am   not   made   of   their   hard   ware .   My   eyes   no sooner   got   well   than   I   was   teized   with   ye   rheumatism &   could   not   bear   the   writing   posture .   As   soon   as   I   grew better   Mr   Montagu   fell   ill   of   a   violent   cough   &   kept his   room   three   weeks :   to   day   he   is   to   dine   below   for the   first   time .   The   offices   of   Nurse   &   secretary ,   for I   am   both   to   him ,   have   so   fill'd   all   my   time   that except   for   purposes   of   business   I   have   lived   without benefit   of   clergy .   Your   letter   last   night   gave   me most   sincere   pleasure ,   I   imagined   you   thought   I   was grown   a   brute ,   &   unless   you   could   make   a   good   fable of   my   metamorphosis   would   have   nothing   to   say to   me .   I   intended   writing   to   you   as   soon   as   I   got a   free   morning   which   I   date   only   from   today   that Mr   Montagu   quits   his   apartment .   Miss   Talbot   calld on   me   the   other   day   when   I   was   just   gone   to   Lady Frances   Williams   who   came   to   Town   the   night   before . I   had   not   seen   her   since   the   death   of   Lady   Essex , so   the   meeting   was   painfull ;   but   she   bore   up better   than   I   expected :   and   I   have   the   comfort   of finding   her   less   dejected   than   I   fear'd .   I   do   not imagine   that   after   such   a   shock   she   will   ever be   capable   of   the   lively   joy ,   which   the   mind   feels Before   it   has   tasted   such   deadly   sorrow :   but   I   really hope   she   will   recover   a   sort   of   tranquillity ,   in   the   great palace   de   la   tristesse   there   are   very   different   apartmts : some   are   utterly   dark   &   comfortless ;   others   admit   a twilight   in   which   no   object   appears   brilliant or   gaily   colour'd ,   but   where   the   true   shape   and form   of   things   appear .   Sickness   &   age ,   &   most   of   all   sorrow , may   soon   change   the   gay   picture   to   meer   black   &   white , &   one   is   surprized   to   find   there   is   so   little   beauty in   the   meer   outline   of   what   appear'd   so   charming when   colour'd :   but   if   the   things   of   this   World   do   not assume   a   terrible   form ,   or   become   obliterated   by   grief , I   do   not   know   whether   the   evil   be   so   great   to   a Christian ,   the   un dazzled   sight   will   look   onward to   an   eternity   where   no   shadows ,   no   delusive   joys await   our   coming ,   and   we   shall   thank   the   voice that   told   us   what   we   gazed   on   enamoured ,   was   an insubstantial   shadow .   Here   I   was   interrupted   by   a   visit from   my   friend   Mr   Burke .   It   is   a   noble   privilege in   a   London   life   that   one   can   never   be   too   long in   the   same   temper   ,   whether   willingly   or   unwillingly ,   one   must   steer "" from   grave   to   gay ,   from   lively   to   severe . ""   I   am   very   glad you   liked   Mr   Burkes   book ,   he   is   as   good   &   worthy   as he   is   ingenious .   The   press   has   not   furnishd   us   with any   thing   of   late   worthy   your   attention ,   nor   have the   genius's   of   France   sent   their   wit   to   the   mint to   be   made   into   currency ,   as   the   rich   have   their plate .   I   was   very   happy   when   I   last   saw   Miss Talbot   to   find   her   health   so   establish'd ,   I   look upon   her   life   as   a   publick   concern ,   for   she   is   ever Ready   to   relieve   distress   &   protect   merit ,   &   gives   a sweet   example   to   the   World   of   the   amiableness   of Virtue .   Then   as   your   friend   I   am   most   terribly   interested for   her   welfare .   Whenever   you   suffer   I   am   in   pain ,   I want   to   keep   you   in   this   World ,   &   yet   to   have   you happier   than   this   World   can   make   you ,   I   want a   little   Island   for   you   which   should   be   suitable to   you ,   you   should   read   upon   violets   be   fanned   by zephers   &   shaded   by   woodbine   &   roses   in   a   moral sense ,   your   mind   seems   too   pure   to   live   in   fogs , too   gentle   for   North   Wind ,   our   moral   atmosphere our   material   World   is   not   worthy   of   you   but   if you   must   lead   ye   usual   life   come   to   Clargesstreet My   heart   rejoyces   at   ye   thought ,   &   echo's   come   to Clarges   streets .   You   do   not   say   a   syllable   of   your health ,   as   to   mine   it   is   now   very   good ,   I   am   weary of   ye   dissipation   I   have   lived   in ,   not   an   hour   I could   call   my   own   between   domestick   duties   & the   ceremonies   of   life .   I   never   told   you   that yr   Brother   was   once   so   good   as   to   dine   with me ,   I   like   him   vastly .   I   can   tell   you   he   has   ye good   fortune   to   resemble   you .   If   you   do   not   come to   Town   now   you   have   flatterd   me   with   hopes of   it   you   have   done   an   ill   thing ,   you   cannot imagine   how   many   things   that   before   this   news pleased   me   very   well   have   now   lost   their   value , agreable   people   sell   at   no   price ,   many   even   wise &   good   are   fallen   below   par .   My   mind   anticipates your   arrival   &   I   have   been   angry   at   every body   that   came   in   that   they   were   not   Miss Carter .   If   I   was   to   prescribe   a   temperate   regimen For   my   mind   I   should   never   come   to   the   luxurious feast   of   your   conversation .   You   have   made   me   nice &   dainty   so   look   that   you   do   not   leave   me   to   starve pray   come   to   Clarges .   I   am   to   go   Lady   F:   Williams to   night ,   she   enquired   after   you   last   time   I   saw her ,   you   cannot   imagine   how   the   chorus   of   my friends   will   join   to   say   to   you   Come   to   Clarges Street .   Mrs   Pitt   is   in   Town   &   longs   for   you . I   shall   hope   to   have   yr   commands   to   get   yr apartment   air'd .   I   can   say   nothing   that   appears to   me   to   have   any   sense   in   it   but   pray   come to   Clarges   street .   Adieu   !   My   Dear   friend   believe me   that   no   one   can   esteem   &   love   you   more than   I   do ,   esteem   me   for   that   esteem   &   love   me   for that   love ,   for   indeed   I   know   nothing   in   me   so well   to   be   liked   so   much   to   be   approved .

BC_1759_EMONTAGU_ED	Saturday - My   Dearest I   flatter   myself   that   my   letter may   come   as   a   congratulation   to   you   on   ye   conclusion of   yr   business   in   Northumberland .   I   hope   this   & many   succeeding   years   will   give   you   the   peacefull harvest   of   yr   toils .   You   are   both   labourer   & farmer ,   you   will   enjoy   what   yr   pains have   sown   &   reap'd .   I   dined   to   day   with   my Father   who   desired   his   compts   to   you .   I   beg of   you   to   make   my   apology   to   Mrs   Isaacson for   not   writing   to   her   by   this   post .   I   went in   ye   morning   to   visit   Mrs   Sherlock   & the   Bishop   of   London   &   was   by   them   most courteously   received ,   I   called   at   ye   Admly &   was   detaind   till   it   was   time   to   dress for   dinner ,   then   went   to   my   Fathers it   is   now   too   late   to   write   to   Mrs   Isaacson so   I   must   beg   credit   to   another   post   &   ye rather   as   I   have   a   little   pain   in   my stomach   which   writing   wd   probably   increase . For   which   reason   I   know   you   will   accept of   a   short   letter .   Ld   Westmoreland   is   chosen Chancellor   by   a   majority   of   an   . Lady   Medows   was   yesterday   when   I   calld   as well   as   usual .   I   went   in   ye   morning .   I   was   at ye   play   last   night   where   I   was   poorly   amusd ye   peice   tho   Shakespears   is   a   very   bad   one , ye   character   of   Cleopatra   absurd   &   unnatural . &   ye   whole   piece   bombast   &   stiff ,   with   few of   those   touches   of   genius   which   usually adorn   even   ye   indifferent   peices   of   his   writing . Mr   Garrick   has   been   at   a   vast   expence for   dress   &   scenery ,   but   that   will   not   to people   of   taste   make   amends   for   ye   defective performance .   I   had   not   read   this   play   for many   years   &   coud   not   think   it   possible Shakespear   wd   write   &   a   modern   actor revive   such   trash .   I   long   for   next   post   as it   will   probably   intimate   something   of ye   time   of   yr   return   which   will   be   ye Most   agreable   news   to   my   Dearest   love your   very   affectionate   Gratefull and   most   faithfull   Wife E M 
BC_1759_EMONTAGU_FB	I   received   my   Dear   Friends   enlivening , vivifying   restorative ,   antihysterical   epistle   just   before I   set   out   for   Lady   Smythes ,   at   my   return   had a   letter   of   business   to   write   to   my   Sister ,   so this   is   to   shew   my   love   that's   all   thats   in   it . but   how   we   talk   of   love   good   Madam   do you   think   affairs   may   not   have   made a   great   progress   between   the   admiral   &   me before   next   month ?   Has   not   he   taken   l l'invincible   &   l'intrepide   &   le   glorieux   after only   an   hours   engagement ,   &   the   great unutterable   name   of   Hoquart   pour   la   troisieme fois   ,   &   you   trust   me   here   till   next month !   Really   you   are   very   rash   &   perhaps you   may   repent   it   for   I   am   so   piqued   at your   staying   in   the   Country   I   do   not   know what   I   may   do   in   my   resentment ,   however that   there   might   be   no   treachery   in   the Case   I   thought   it   best   to   apprize   you   of your   danger ;   but   to   be   serious ,   I   must   own you   plead   pretty   good   reasons   for   yr   Stay   at Hatchlands   &   I   share   ye   Joy   of   yr   present &   I   congratulate   you   on   the   good   health Mr   Boscawen   has   brought   home   pray God   continue   &   augment   yr   blessings   they are   all   felt   by   her   who   is   sincerely Yrs E M Mr   Boscawen   wd   tell you   I   was   well   &   in   good spirits   but   I   shall   be still   better   when   you   come to   us .

BC_1759_EMONTAGU_GL_1	Tuesday   ye   My   Lord If   the   sentiment   of   gratitude   would   not   pass for   payment   with   generous   benefactors ,   how   embarass'd would   Lord   Lytteltons   correspondents   be   to   acquit   themselves of   their   obligations   to   him !   but   when   I   have   told   your Lordship   that   your   letter   gave   me   great   pleasure ,   &   I   return most   gratefull   thanks   for   it ,   a   sense   of   the   favour   remains but   it   appears   no   longer   a   demand   unsatisfied   tho   it is   a   debt   I   cannot   pay .   I   have   enclosed   a   letter   I   received from   Emin   last   post ,   I   am   sure   your   Lordship   will   approve his   not   returning   to   England ,   &   particularly   his   delicacy in   not   exposing   his   friends   to   the   imputation   of   having protected   an   impostor .   You   will   find   his   mind   is   still at   the   top   of   the   heroick   strain ,   an   asiatick ,   a   savage ,   & a   Hero   in   a   fever   is   a   very   terrible   animal .   Love   of   fame &   ambition   of   conquest   give   delirium   enough   without   an   inflamation of   the   blood ,   &   the   natives   of   the   warm   climates seem   at   best   hardly   in   sober   senses .   I   wish   your   Lordship would   write   to   him ,   he   takes   my   letter   very   kindly tho'   it   run   directly   against   the   grain   of   his   heroism , but   he   may   think   what   I   say   to   him   is   dictated by   the   weakness   &   timidity   of   an   effeminate   mind But   he   knows   your   Lordships   is   capable   of   no   fear   but that   which   is   the   beginning   of   wisedom . I   had   a   very   obliging   letter   from   Mrs   Lyttelton   last   post for   we   have   corresponded   since   Dr   F-s   proposal   to her ,   she   is   soon   to   go   to   Bath   to   nurse   Dr   Ascough   &   comfort her   Sister :   at   the   same   time   I   had   a   letter   from   Mr   Tom   Pitt   with a   postscript   from   the   Dean   of   Exeter ,   who   I   believe   had not   heard   of   the   death   of   the   Bishop   of   Worchester .   I   wish the   lawn   sleeves   may   be   now   prepared   for   my   friend . I   hope   your   Lordship   found   Mrs   Pitt   improved   in   health one   has   nothing   else   to   wish   for   her .   She   is   form'd   for society   in   a   very   peculiar   manner ,   no   one   puts   more wit   vivacity   &   politeness   into   general   conversation ,   & the   depth   acuteness   &   finesse   of   her   understanding make   her   charming   in   a   tête   à   tête   . I   propose   to   be   in   Town   on   saturday ,   but   if   any   thing should   defer   my   journey   your   Lordship   shall   hear from   me   again ,   but   as   I   had   much   rather   have the   pleasure   of   seeing   you   than   of   writing   to   you , I   hope   I   shall   not   have   so   good   an   excuse   to trouble   you   with   another   letter ,   but   viva   voce wish   you   a   good   journey   to   Hagley . I   had   by   mistake   left   Strada's   prolusions   in   Town ,   so   that I   have   not   read   them ,   I   think   your   Lordship   has   an interest   in   wishing   your   friends   to   study   the   art   of writing   history ,   from   Rapin   one   may   extract   an   eloge of   the   history   of   Henry   the   Second .   I   am   much   pleased with   the   subject   of   Busbequius   letters   &   his   manner , he   tells   the   story   of   Mustapha   &   his   son   ,   with   the   brevity   of   a letter   writer   &   the   dignity   of   an   historian .   It   is   strange that   Princes   do   no   think   it   worth   their   while   to   send men   of   genius   well   pension'd   to   learn   whatever   is   extraordinary &   good   in   the   constitution   &   customs   of   distant nations .   When   I   am   queen   of   the   East   I   shall   send   a Naturalist ,   a   Politician ,   &   a   man   of   sense ,   into   every country   in   the   World ;   the   two   first   shall   write   memoirs &   the   third   his   annotations   upon   them .   The   Dean   of Exeter   &   Mr   Tom   Pitt   have   been   at   Sr   Edwd   Lytteltons   in Staffordshire .   I   have   been   obliged   to   write   five   letters   this morning ,   so   I   have   not   time   to   be   longer   troublesome to   your   Lordship .   Mr   Montagu   desires   his   most   respectfull compliments . I   am   my   Lord Your   Obliged   Obedient and   most   faithfull   Hble   Servt E   Montagu 
BC_1759_EMONTAGU_GL_2	Oct   ye     I   am   afraid   your   Lordship   will   think   I am   very   impertinent   to   break   in   upon   your   business   at   Hagley with   a   frivolous   letter ,   but   when   I   tell   you   I   write   at   the request   of   a   friend   I   hope   it   will   dispell   any   frown   your brow   may   have   contracted ;   or   at   least   that   I   shall   not   be the   object   of   your   displeasure   who   had   not   the   least intention   of   writing   to   you   to   day .   After   so   long   an   absence from   home   you   must   have   a   great   deal   of   business ,   and   it is   cruel   to   be   interrupted   in   it   by   idle   correspondents ,   so   that I   feel   both   fear   &   reluctance   in   setting   down   to   write   to   yr   Lordship However   as   a   friend   wants   your   councils   &   sollicits   me   to write   for   them   I   hope   you   will   excuse   it .   The   friend   I   would intimate ,   is   the   Person   whom   I   told   your   Lordship   I   suspected to   be   the   Author   of   a   letter   lately   publish'd :   you   know the   delicacies   of   their   situation ,   &   will   not   wonder   they should   wish   to   consult   the   Person   in   the   World   of   whose wisedom   and   fidelity   they   have   the   highest   opinion . but But   the   subject   on   which   they   would   consult   you is   of   too   much   importance   to   them   to   be   convey d   by By   the   post ,   so   that   I   was   only   to   tell   your   Lordship   that they   were   in   want   of   your   advice ,   and   wish'd   you   would come   to   Town   as   early   in   November   as   you   could .   I   assured them   you   had   business   in   the   Country   that   could   not be   neglected ,   I   was   answer'd   he   was   not   made   for   the mean   occupations   of   a   Country   Gentleman ;   and   then a   long   conversation   was   begun   in   which   the   greatest respect   &   zeal   for   you   was   express'd ,   &   much   intimated of   the   high   opinion   others   had   of   you .   I   assured   the person   over   &   over   that   you   could   not   be   here   long   before the   birth   day ,   that   my   advice   to   you   to   come   then   had been   but   ill   received ,   &   therefore   I   wish'd   they   wd write   themselves ,   but   they   did   not   care   to   write   by this   post .   Here   ends   my   negotiation ,   &   in   all   reason   my letter   should   end   here   too ;   but   as   your   Lordship   must have   some   idle   moment   which   you   would   give   to   a news   paper   you   may   as   well   hear   from   me   how   the World   goes   on   here .   I   wrote   a   letter   to   Lady   Townshend to   congratulate   her   on   Mr   Townshends   success   at Quebeck ,   to   which   I   had   the   most   obliging   answer imaginable ,   it   was   as   affectionate   as   to   a   daughter and   as   respectfull   as   to   an   Empress .   She   said   her   spirits had   been   so   worn   out   she   could   not   recover   her dejection   &   begg'd   to   see   me   on   sunday   I   found   her very   low   spirited   still   tho'   pleased   with   the   late event .   Mr   Charles   Townshend   was   excessively   gracious to   me ,   &   we   talk'd   of   the   affair   of   Quebeck   with the   regards   due   to   Genl   Townshend .   Mr   Wolfe   was killd ,   &   Gl   Monckton   wounded   early   in   the   action , so   that   certainly   much   of   the   glory   of   the   day   belongs justly   to   Mr   Townshend ,   but   to   shew   how   precarious the   affections   of   the   people   are ,   it   is   not   the   fashion to   give   him   any   share   of   the   honour ,   his   letter is   criticised   as   if   he   was   a   Secretary   &   not   a   General : but   most   remarkable   it   is   that   in   the   Citty   address the   whole   glory   is   given   to   Mr   Wolfe ,   without   the least   mention   of   ye   other   officers .   What   an   opinion does   this   give   one   of   the   wisedom ,   justice   &   generosity of   the   publick !   The   encomiums   on   Mr   Wolfe   run   very high ,   a   great   action   is   perform'd   &   envy   can   endure to   give   praise   to   a   dead   Man ;   and   there   was   certainly something   very   captivating   in   his   character ;   he   took   the publick   opinion   by   a   coup   de   main   ,   to   which   it   surrenders more   willingly   than   to   a   regular   siege .   The   people   had not   time   to   be   tired   of   hearing   him   call'd   the   Brave ,   he   is   the subject   of   all   peoples   praise ,   and   I   question   whether   all   the Duke   of   Marlbroughs   conquests   gaind   him   greater   honour . a   long   series   of   great   actions   &   merit   shewn   through   a long   period   of   time ,   &   on   various   occasions ,   must   gain a   lasting   reputation ,   but   in   life   as   in   writing   what   is short   but   compleat   bears   ye   character   of   sublime .   Our friend   Monsey   is   gone   to   Claremont .   I   was   glad   to   find By   a   letter   Miss   Hanley   wrote   me   the   day   before   your Lordship   went   to   Clewer   that   Mrs   Hanley   was   better . I   hope   your   Lordship   is   in   better   health   than   when you   left   London ,   &   that   you   found   Mr   Lyttelton   well .   I   hear our   army   in   Germany   is   very   sickly .   I   believe   I   made my   last   visit   to   Lady   Medows   this   afternoon ,   after   so long   illness   she   has   a   very   painfull   exit .   it   was   fortunate for   me   that   she   did   not   ask   me   to   attend   her ,   for   tho I   am   in   as   good   health   &   spirits   as   possible ,   yet   I   found the   object   affect   my   nerves .   She   may   still   last   sometime , but   I   believe   can   hardly   live   till   morning .   She   has   not desired   to   see   her   Brother   or   any   friend .   Your   Lordship   will send   me   an   answer   to   this   to   shew   to   our   friend ,   who will   otherwise   imagine   I   have   not   obey'd   their   command for   indeed   I   promised   to   do   it   with   that   reluctance   with which   I   should   undertake   any   thing   that   could   appear to   your   Lordship   as   an   impertinent   &   troublesome   sollicition and   I   know   it   is   not   in   your   power   to   leave   your business   in   the   Country   as   soon   as   they   wish . I   am   my   Lord Your   Lordships Most   Obliged   &   Obedt Humble   Servant E:M: 
BC_1759_EMONTAGU_SS_1	ye   My   Dear   Sister I   should   have   answered   your   letter letter   last   post ,   but   I   have   been   a   good   deal   engaged   with attendance   on   Mr   Montagu   who   was   taken   ill   of   a   little fever   on   this   day   sennight ,   he   appeard   very   well   in the   morning ,   &   was   very   merry   with   my   Brother William   who   was   that   day   to   go   to   Winchester ,   we carried   him   in   the   Coach   as   far   as   Kingsclare ,   &   then Mr   Montagu ,   Dr   Monsey   &   Your   Hble   Servt   went   to   see Mr   Cottington   house ,   as   we   came   down   ye   Hill   Mr Montagu   found   himself   not   well ,   but   wd   not   let ye   Doctor   do   any   thing   for   him   for   four   days ;   but at   ye   end   of   them   said   he   wd   now   resign   himself to   ye   management   of   the   learned ,   for   he   found   he could   not   get   well   without   assistance .   We   hope   the fever   is   quite   off   to   day ,   &   yesterday   it   was   very slight ,   but   he   has   a   troublesome   cough ,   however   we hope   he   will   be   well   enough   to   take   ye   air   tomorrow &   a   few   days   air   &   exercise   I   hope   will   quite   recover his   strength   &   appetite   which   at   present   are   deficient . Mr   Montagu   thanks   you   for   yr   letter   which   is   very obliging   &   will   write   you   his   acknowledgments   when he   is   able .   He   was   blooded   two   days   ago   but   his   blood   was so   thick   it   was   difficult   to   get   any   out ,   &   at   last ye   Doctor   could   not   get   so   much   as   he   wish'd .   It   was Very   fortunate   that   Dr   Monsey   happend   to   be   here   for   it is   so   difficult   to   prevail   on   Mr   Montagu   to   send   for a   physician   that   perhaps   he   wd   have   let   ye   fever take   too   strong   hold   before   any   help   had   been   got .   He has   not   been   in   ye   least   danger ,   but   indeed   has   sufferd much   from   bad   nights ,   loss   of   strength   &   appetite   for   he   loaths nourishment   of   all   kinds .   The   Doctor   desires   him   to drink   plentifully   of   small   liquers ,   but   we   have   sometimes a   pretty   stout   argument   before   he   will   swallow   a bason   of   any   sort   of   liquid .   I   was   much   grieved   to   lay aside   my   scheme   of   coming   to   Bath   Easton ,   but   we had   then   such   accounts   of   Lady   Medows   as   made   it uncertain   whether   I   should   not   have   been   obliged to   have   left   you   perhaps   the   day   after   I   came ,   for Mr   Montagu   seem'd   to   intimate   that   I   must   go   to Town   with   him   directly   if   such   an   event   was   to happen ,   I   fancy   ye   good   Lady   will   have   ye   complaisance to   save   him   a   journey   to   Town   on   purpose ,   business will   oblige   us   to   go   to   London   before   ye   end   of   September I   fear ,   for   Mr   Montagu   is   very   desirous   to   finish   his affairs   as   Executor   to   Mr   Rogers .   He   wants   too   to   go to   Newcastle   to   settle   with   Mr   Isaacson ,   but   I   do   not think   his   constitution   strong   enough   for   such   a   journey late   in   ye   year .   I   proposed   if   he   went   to   Newcastle to   take   then   a   little   trip   to   Bath   to   see   you ,   for   indeed it   wd   be   barbarous   to   come   into   your   house   to   eject these   good   people   who   are   not   only   as   loving ,   but while   with   you ,   as   happy   as   ye   first   pair   in   Paradise , but   in   that   case   I   could   have   taken   a   lodging   &   beggd them   to   change   for   a   little   while ,   but   I   could   not honestly   have   used   ye   old   proverb   that   exchanges Is   no   robbery .   From   the   account   you   give   of   your   Clergyman I   am   sorry   he   could   not   stay   in   the   West   Indies   where they   much   want   Pastors   of   zeal   &   piety .   In   converting Infidels   I   wish   the   preachers   wd   consider   the   dangers of   being   half   a   Christian ,   &   that   they   shd   either   take true   pains   with   their   flock   or   leave   them   to   that mercy   which   can   better   pardon   ignorance   than   wilfull sinfulness .   Dr   Monsey   desires   his   most   respectfull ,   affectionate , tender ,   &   passionate   compliments   to   you .   he   design d returning   to   London   on   monday ,   but   he   will   now   stay till   Mr   Montagu   can   conveniently   spare   him .   I   live in   hopes   of   seeing   you   here ,   if   you   come   I   will   excuse myself   from   going   to   Town   when   Mr   Montagu   goes up   for   I   shall   not   be   of   ye   least   use   in   finishing his   accounts   now ,   as   they   are   all   now   ready   for the   Lawyer   &   I   shall   be   glad   to   be   excused   being in   Town   at   a   time   of   ye   year   that   London   is   dull &   ye   Country   still   pleasant ,   so   let   not   my that   shorten your   stay   here ,   but   however   come   as   soon   as   it   is fit   for   you ,   that   I   may   have   ye   more   of   your company ,   but   I   say   all   this   with   submission   to your   health   for ,   I   wd   not   have   you   run   any   hazards for   any   consideration .   I   think   some   way   or   other   ye year   wd   not   pass   without   my   seeing   you ,   but   had much   rather   it   were   here ,   for   indeed   if   Mr   Montagus health ,   which   between   ourselves   is   not   quite   what it   was   some   years ,   &   indeed   months   ago ,   shd   grow   worse   I   shall   not be   at   liberty   to   ramble   about .   He   had   a   little   fever before   since   we   came   hither   &   the   bad   state   of his   blood   makes   me   apprehensive   he   may   be liable   to   them ,   or   to   other   complaints .   It   is   said   sometimes That   people   get   bread   when   they   have   not   teeth to   cut   it ,   I   am   afraid   I   have   got   wings   when I   must   not   fly ,   new   journeys   wd   be   pleasant   &   ye expense   is   of   no   consequence   perhaps   accidents will   fix   me   down .   I   expect   ye   pleasure   of   seeing   Miss Carter   in   her   way   to   Town .   I   believe   I   told   you   Mrs Southwell   made   a   visit   in   her   way   to   Kingsweston . I   expect   my   Brother   Charles   this   week .   Miss   Carter will   only   call   for   a   few   hours   which   is   very   grievous but   I   find   she   thinks   herself   obliged   to   accompany Miss   Talbot   to   London .   I   hope   Lady   Bab   does   not   still think   that   I   wd   desire   her   to   make   herself   sick in   return   for   her   having   done   me   a   great   favour . I   beg   my   most   affectionate   &   gratefull   compts   to   her Ladyship .   I   assure   you   I   did   not   part   with   Dionysius with   any   regret ,   I   shd   not   yet   have   begun   it ,   nor am   in   ye   least   haste ,   &   you   make   so   good   use of   history   it   wd   be   strange   not   to   be   glad   to   furnish you   with   it .   When   I   have   given   Dionysius   one   reading I   will   send   it   to   you   again   to   remain   with   you . I   will   also   send   you   Blains   chronology   when   I leave   Sandleford .   I   must   return   to   my   Invalid   so only   desire   my   compts   to   Miss   Arnold .   I   am   my Dear   Sister most   tenderly   &   affectly   yours E M

I   designd   to   have   wrote   you   a   very   long   letter   but was   prevented   by   an   accident   very   long   it   must have   been   if   it   had   express'd   a   thousandth   part of   ye   happiness   I   had   in   yr   company   or   ye pain   I   had   in   parting   with   it .

The   post   is   going   so   can only   say I   am Ever   most   affectly   yours E M You   will   be   glad   to   hear   Mr   Montagu   is   much   better than   when   you   left   him 
BC_175x_EMONTAGU_SS	Hillstreet   Dear   Sister If   I   could   have   given   you   any tolerable   account   of   my   self ,   or   indeed   had   been   able to   have   given   any   account   at   all ,   you   should   have heard   from   me   before   this   time .   I   came   to   Town but   saturday   sennight   in   a   very   bad   plight . I   had   every   other   night   a   spasm   in   my stomach ,   it   seized   me   always   between   &   ,   gave   me   much   pain   &   sickness ,   & left   me   weak ,   low ,   &   miserable .   I   have   now miss d   ye   fit   twice ,   &   have   all   the   marks of   convalescence ,   but   I   have   still   a   grievous nervous   cough   which   hinders   my   sleeping , yet   my   spirits   are   much   better   than they   were ,   &   I   hope   soon   to   be   as   well   as usual   only   that   I   shall   not   easily regain   those   pleasing   hopes   of   health Which   I   had   before   this   attack .   Dr   Shaw   has attended   me   twice   a   day   ever   since   I   came to   Town ,   but   now   tells   me   I   shall   be   able to   take   care   of   myself .   I   am   not   yet   allowd to   go   out .   tho   if   the   weather   was   fine   I should   venture   to   take   ye   air   in   a   morning . Lady   Bab   was   so   good   as   to   call   on   me on   monday   morning .   I   think   that   her   looks do   credit   to   a   milk   diet .   Mr   Botham   has been   of   great   comfort   to   me   in   my   illness he   is   the   best   of   nurses .   Our   Dear   Captain went   out   of   Town   on   sunday ,   he   will   soon   set sail   but   is   at   present   at   Gravesend .   I   shall be   obliged   to   you   if   you   will   send   ye   Bath bags   &   woollen   stockings ,   they   are   accoutremts becoming   an   invalid .   I   hope   soon   to   write you   a   longer   letter .   Mrs   Botham   &   Mr Montagu   desire   their   compts I   am   Dear   Sister ever   most   affectly   yrs E M 
BC_1760_EMONTAGU_BS	Dear   Sir Tho   I   have   got   an   inflammation   in   my   eyes which   almost   incapacitates   me   for   writing   I   cannot   help telling   you   that   Dr   Monsey   has   given   me   great pleasure ,   &   fear   I   shall   never   be   able   to   scold   him again   for   being   a   blab   when   I   owe   so   much   joy to   that   quality   on   ye   present   occasion .   When   I consider   your   virtues   &   talents   one   by   one ,   I   am very   much   discontented   at   ye   smalness   of   ye   present fortune   makes   you   when   I   consider   them   alltogether   I find   out   that   ye   effect   of   such   a   combination is   to   be   easily   satisfied   &   above   ye   vanities of   life ,   &   I   can   better   be   pleased   with   what I   hope   is   only   an   earnest   of   fortunes   favour . We   had   a   rumour   that   his   Prussian   Majestys army   had   been   beaten   most   unmercifully ,   it   is now   hoped   the   report   was   false .   I   have   just   received A   letter   from   Mr   Torriano   who   has   been   very   good   to   me in   taking   much   pains   to   find   me   lodgings at   Tunbridge .   &   I   shall   now   compass   that   matter &   get   there   about   ye     of   this   month .   I   have had   a   letter   from   Lady   Frances   Williams   &   Mrs Trevor   to   day ,   they   are   both   well .   My   complaint in   my   eyes   almost   gives   me   ye   vapours , &   I   can   by   experience   contradict   Mr   Bruyeres maxim ,   qu'il   vaut   mieux   passer   sa   vie à   ne   rien   faire ,   qu'   à   faire   des   riens   .   Monsey &   I   love   one   another   as   if   we   were   in   ye first   page   of   our   novel ,   we   have   gone   visiting in   together   in   a   post   chaise ,   we   have   had assignations   even   at   ye   holy   palace   of ye   Archbishop ,   besides   ten   thousand   little tendernesses ,   indeed   I   think   we   have   travelld through   ye   whole   carte   du   tendre   according to   ye   best   edition   of   Clelies   .   Mr   Montagu   desires his   compts .   Moncys   letter   to   you   arrived   on   Saturday but   I   was   out   of   Town .   I   am   Dear   Sir Yr   Most   affecte   Hble Servt   E M 
BC_1760_EMONTAGU_EC_1	The   Bishop   of   Elphin   has   carried   his   cause   in our   house   of   Peers   in   which   charity   equity   & Lady   Frances   William   triumph I   have   just   received   my   Dear   Mrs Carters   letter ,   &   am   very   happy   in   her   approbation of   ye   dialogues .   With   her   encouragement   I   do   not   know but   at   last   I   may   become   an   author   in   form . It   enlarges   ye   sphere   of   action ,   &   lengthens   ye short   period   of   human   life .   To   become   universal &   lasting   is   an   ambition   which   none   but   great genius's   should   indulge ;   but   to   be   read   by   a   few , &   for   a   few   years ,   may   be   aspired   to .   We   see   in Nature   some   birds   are   destined   to   range   the   vast region   of   ye   air ,   others   to   fly   &   hop   near   the ground ,   &   pick   up   the   worms ,   I   shall   think   my self   happy   if   I   can   do   anything   towards clearing   society   of   their   lower   &   meanest   follies . The   dialogues ,   I   mean   the   three   worst ,   have   had a   more   favorable   reception   than   I   expected . Lord   Lytteltons   have   been   admired   to   ye   highest degree ,   which   indeed   they   deserve .   I   am   sensible of   ye   great   disadvantage   the   others   have   in Following   them .   Mrs   Modish   is   a   great   favorite   with the   Town ,   but   some   Ladies   have   toss'd   up   their heads   &   said   it   was   abominably   satirical .   you will   hear   from   Lambeth   how   they   are   all   approved of .   The     last   were   for   some   days   attributed to   Mr   Charles   York ,   but   alas !   They   are   now mostly   given   to   ye   true   Author .   Lady   F:   Williams &   ye   authors   friends   had   little   doubt .   Mrs   Donnellan wrote   a   note   insisting   to   be   inform d   whether they   were   yours   or   --   I   got   myself   pretty well   out   of   ye   scrape ,   &   feeling   they   were unworthy   of   you ,   I   took   care   to   intimate   they were   not   your   writing .   My   friendship   resisted ye   temptation   of   giving   you   the   blame .   I   believe without   telling   a   direct   fib   I   have   puzzled Donnellans   curiosity .   Few   have   had   the   indelicacy to   ask ,   but   several   have   hinted   &   I   have parry'd   the   blow .   I   have   long   been   sorry   to   see the   best   of   our   Sex   running   continually   after publick   spectacles   &   diversions ,   to   ye   ruin   of their   health   &   understandings ,   &   neglect   of All   domestick   duties ;   but   I   own   the   late   instance of   their   going   to   hear   Lord   Ferrers   sentence particularly   provoked   me .   The   Ladies   crouded to   ye   house   of   Lords   to   see   a   wretch   brought loaded   with   crime   &   shame   to   ye   bar   to   hear sentence   of   a   cruel   &   ignominious   death . which   considering   only   this   world ,   cast   shame back   on   his   ancestors ,   &   all   his   Succeeding   family . There   was   in   this   case   every   thing   that could   disgrace   human   nature   &   civil distinctions ;   but   it   was   a   sight ,   &   in   spite of   all   pretenses   to   tenderness   &   delicacy   they went   adorn'd   with   jewels ,   &   laughing   &   gay , to   see   their   fellow   creature   in   the   most   horrid situation ,   making   a   sad   end   of   this   life ,   & in   fearfull   expectation   of   ye   commencement of   another .   These   Ladies   wd   be   angry   if   one could   suppose   they   wd   delight   to   see   ye blows   &   cuts   boxers   or   backsword   champions give   each   other ,   yet   honour ,   spirit ,   &   courage animate   these   combatants ;   nothing   but a   criminal   insensibility ,   ye   most   wicked Hardness   of   heart   could   support   Lord   Ferrers under   his   crime   &   disgrace .   Can   one   wonder that   mistaken   piety   can   make   people   spectators of   ye   horrors   of   an   auto   de   Fe ,   when   ye love   of   Spectacles   can   carry   Women   to   see a   Murderer   receive   sentence !   If   I   had   been   one of   his   Judges   I   should   have   submitted   to   ye pain   of   passing   sentence ;   but   if   justice   does not   call   one   to   a   scene   of   punishment what   could   induce   one   to   be   present   at   it ?   You will   believe   Mrs   Modish   was   there ,   tho   she does   not   mention   it . Lady   Frances   Williams   &   Mrs   Pitt   were   here   last night .   I   have   pass'd   this   evening   alone   as quietly   as   if   I   had   been   in   ye   Country .   The bad   weather   kept   me   in   Town .   I   ask   pardon that   I   have   not   sent   you   ye   directions   proposals for   Thucydides ,   you   shall   have   it   in   my next .   Pray   let   me   know   the   sentence   of   ye Academy   of   Sciences   at   Deal   on   ye   Dialogues . Adieu   Dear   Madam   believe   me   most   affectly &   tenderly   yours E M I   beg   you   to   inform   me   of   ye state   of   ye   Dean   of   Canterburys health   but   not   to   mention   my   enquiry 
BC_1760_EMONTAGU_EC_2	Newcastle   ye   I   was   totally   incapable   of   thanking my   Dear   Mrs   Carter   for   her   letter   last   post   by   an   outrageous pain   in   my   teeth   &   face .   I   am   now   in   a   state   of   stupidity enliven'd   with   a   little   pain .   I   have   the   weight   of a   great   cold ,   with   the   twitchings   of   the   toothach .   I   think I   have   prepared   you   to   expect   a   very   dull   letter   but I   cannot   longer   delay   telling   you   how   anxious   my mind   is   about   you .   I   thank   you   for   the   sonnet   which would   have   given   me   a   pleasing   melancholly if   it   had   not   represented   your   state   &   condition ,   as it   did ,   it   cost   me   some   tears   &   obliged   me   to   go from   table   where   I   received   your   letter .   Teach   me to   love   you   less   or   imitate   you   better .   I   admire   the resignation   with   you   submit   to   your   pain ,   but the   more   I   admire   the   less   I   practise   it .   I   grew impatient   at   the   sufferings   of   my   patient friend .   Cannot   you   hope   for   assistance   from   Physicians ? does   not   your   patience   make   you   neglect   remedies ? I   have   in   the   main   very   well   endured   my   Northumberland life .   Mr   Montagu   by   great   diligence   and application   has   brought   our   most   important   affairs near   a   conclusion ,   &   when   they   are   finish'd   I   shall be   dismiss'd   from   these   cold   regions .   Almost   every day   since   I   came   hither   we   have   had   a   tempest of   wind   &   rain .   As   I   came   so   late   in   the   year ,   & for   so   short   a   time ,   I   chose   to   reside   in   the   Town of   Newcastle   in   a   very   large   good   house   which of   our   late   Cousins .   by   this   means   I   am   better shelter'd   from   the   northern   blasts ,   &   we   are   more in   the   way   of   people   of   business ,   &   I   can   visit the   Newcastle   Dames   shut   up   in   a   sedan   chair which   is   much   better   than   getting   in   &   out   of an   equipage   at   the   door ;   but   not   even   this   can preserve   one   from   hazard   of   cold ,   for   you   must know   as   these   people   enhabit   a   soft   mild   region , they   have   a   thorough   passage   for   the   zephirs , and   as   the   street   door   is   open   behind   when   you Enter ,   there   is   an   open   passage   through   to   the   Garden so   that   a   fine   draught   of   air   is   admitted ,   &   if the   canvass   sail   of   a   large   hoop   was   expanded I   imagine   one   should   often   be   overset   by   the wind .   That   I   might   not   offend   here   I   enter'd   into all   the   diversions   of   this   Town ,   visits ,   concerts   plays &   balls .   The   desire   of   pleasure   &   love   of   dissipation rages   here   as   much   as   in   London .   Diversions   here are   less   elegant ,   &   conversation   less   polite ,   but   no one   imagines   retirement   has   any   comforts ,   so that   in   a   little   while   if   one   would   enjoy   retired leisure   one   must   dwell   amidst   inaccessible mountains   &   unnavigable   rivers .   If   benevolence   impelld to   this   social   intercourse   I   would   endure   the   effect for   the   sake   of   the   lovely   cause ,   but   it   is   merely   the love   of   idleness   that   brings   people   thus   constantly together ,   casual ,   unindear'd ,   joyless   society ,   how can   it   pay   one   for   the   loss   of   hours   which Might   be   spent   in   the   improvement   of   virtue   & knowledge   &   the   quiet   pleasures   of   contemplation ? There   seems   too   much   pride   &   ill   nature   in   living retired   where   other   people   are   mixing   in   society , &   I   will   never   affront   any   particular   set   of   people by   doing   so ;   but   if   this   mode   of   life   continues ,   I shall   endeavour   to   get   myself   a   retreat   in   summer in   some   wild   Country   where   I   may   live   with departed   saints   &   sages   for   some   months   every year ,   rather   than   waste   my   time   on   every   idle fool   that   asks   for   it .   I   had   rather   live   in   Eddystone light   house ,   &   see   nothing   but   the   stars   above   & blank   ocean   below   me ,   than   be   constantly   haunted by   the   human   species ,   but   this   scheme   is   to   be reserved   for   times   of   leisure ,   business   is   a   real   duty . A   prudent   attention   to   ones   affairs   is   so ,   the   careless possessor   of   a   large   fortune   tempts   many   to   become knaves ,   has   nothing   wherewith   to   encourage   merit &   relieve   distress ,   but   turns   a   great   blessing   into   a Curse   &   betrays   a   sacred   trust .   Mrs   Pelt   has   got 
BC_1760_EMONTAGU_ED	Tunbridge   My   Dearest I   return   my   sincerest   thanks   for   your very   kind   &   very   agreable   letter   last   post ,   and   am rejoyced   at   such   a   proof   of   your   perfect   health   as your   not   being   fatigued   with   such   a   long   journey on   horseback .   If   I   had   been   previously   acquainted with   your   design ,   I   should   have   used   my   utmost interest   with   you ,   to   have   travell'd   in   a   post chaise ,   &   have   used   your   horse   only   in   little excursions   about   Sandleford   till   you   was   habituated to   the   exercise   of   riding .   We   hear   the   ministry are   a   little   afraid   of   a   Spanish   war ,   it   looks too   much   by   their   great   Fleet   as   if   they   meant   to urge   us   into   a   peace   on   terms   more   moderate than   our   present   fortune   in   War   should   seem to   prescribe .   We   often   accuse   the   French   of aiming   at   universal   Monarchy   by   endeavouring   to   extend their   dominions ,   other   powers   may   fear   we   should effect   the   same   thing   by   extending   our   commerce , &   in   the   present   state   of   the   World   general commerce   must   give   greatest   power   &   strength .   It   seems to   me   a   far   more   sure   &   lasting   means   of Empire   &   superior   rule ,   than   extent   of   territory . Great   tracts   of   Country   at   distance   from   the seat   of   Government ,   grow   of   little   worth   by the   oppression   of   viceroys   &   deputies ;   if   they   hold the   reins   of   Government   so   tight   as   to   keep what   is   so   out   of   the   sphere   &   influence   of the   laws   of   the   governing   Country   from   rebellion &   anarchy ,   they   must   impede   &   embarass   all   improvements , &   ye   province   in   time   grow   worth   less &   poor .   But   the   smallest   settlements   where the   veins   of   commerce   are   open'd ,   give   real strength   &   riches   to   a   state :   mutual   advantages are   better   securities   than   Cittadels   &   garrisons and   the   unarm'd   merchantman   may   enter   safely   into Harbours   where   the   unwelcome   Ship   of   War would   meet   with   many   dangers .   It   will   be   grievous if   the   spaniards   should   throw   themselves   into the   scale   of   France   which   is   found   light   in the   Naval   balance ,   but   neither   states   nor private   persons   can   attain   glory   without envy ,   or   enjoy   success   without   jealousy .   In   this time   of   success   &   negotiation   that   political thermometer   the   Publick   funds   falls   every   day which   has   a   disagreable   appearance .   Dr   Watson tells   me   the   Philosophers   got   in   right   time   to the   Cape   of   good   Hope ,   &   that   MrHarrisons clock   was   in   its   state   of   perfection   when   the letters   came   away ,   which   is   fortunate   considering that   it   was   in   an   engagement   at   first setting   out   Cannon   ball   might   have destroyd   or   violent   concussions   have   destroyd it .   Which   would   have   been   a   grievous   misfortune and   to   compare   small   things   with   great ,   like the   ruin   of   a   World   where   order   &   beauty   prevaild , brought   about   by   the   rude   impetuous   shock of   a   comet ,   whose   blind   force   &   undirected impetus ,   should   at   once   efface   what   wisdom , &   contrivance ,   &   skill   had   establish'd ,   &   many rolling   years   made   perfect .   I   imagine   the   French themselves   would   have   been   very   sorry   if   they   had destroy d   this   fine   instrument ,   for   the   realms of   science ,   &   the   acquisition   of   invention   are open   to   all ,   &   they   will   share   with   us   the improvements   of   navigation   &   the   ascertainment of   geography .   I   am   glad   you   found   Sandleford smiling   with   plenty ,   &   hope   you   enjoy   some pleasure   there   this   fine   weather .   I   have   found all   imaginable   benefit   to   my   health   from these   waters :   this   dry   season   is   very   favourable to   them .   Lord   &   Lady   Westmorland   are   to   come to   my   Lord   Baths   to   day .   They   will   stay   only three   or   four   days .   All   friends   present   their   compts   I   am my   Dearest   Ever   yrs 
BC_1760_EMONTAGU_GL_1	Newcastle   friday   ye   of   Sept   My   Lord I   must   condole   with   your   Lordship   on   the departure   of   Mr   Rust ;   by   your   description   of   him   I   suspect some   Muse   assumed   a   human   shape   on   purpose   to reside   incognito   at   Hagley   in   a   season   of   jollity   &   la bonne   chere   when   the   spiritual   nine   were   not   invited , nor   expected .   By   the   voice ,   figure ,   and   universality of   talents ,   it   is   probable   it   was   Apollo   himself .   But pray ,   tell   me ,   who   is   this   soy   disant   Mr   Rust ?   is   he   a   gentleman of   fortune   who   takes   his   pleasure   in   the   gardens of   Parnassus ?   or   does   he   toil   in   the   appropriated   fields of   science   as   a   professor ?   I   imagine   by   his   not   being   more celebrated   he   must   be   very   young .   I   rejoyce   that   your Lordship   has   had   a   companion   so   worthy   to   converse with   you ,   for   I   often   pity   your   painfull   preeminence of   talents   &   knowledge ,   which   makes   it   difficult   for   my   Lord Lyttelton   to   meet   with   any   one   capable   of   bearing   a   part in   the   kind   of   conversation   he   would   naturally   chuse . I   know   by   experience   with   what   easy   &   gentle   condescension your   Lordship   can   bend   to   inferior   minds ,   but   it   must   be painfull   to   stoop   continually ,   &   therefore   it   gives   me   pleasure when   I   hear   of   you   having   any   one   with   you   who   can really   amuse   you   &   as   the   County   of   Worcester   will   hardly furnish   many   of   the   cast   of   Mr   Rust   I   shall   not   fear your   Lorships   losing   the   habit   of   condescension ;   nor indeed   can   you   quit   any   habit   taught   by   good   nature and   benevolence .   I   shall   be   very   glad   to   see   Mr   Rusts translations   of   Euripides   &   Sophocles .   I   imagine   Mr   Franklyns translation   to   be   like   the   mask   taken   off   a   fine   face   in plaister   of   paris ;   in   which   the   features   of   the   original are   exactly   mark'd   &   the   air   of   countenance   preserved , but   many   a   delicate   touch   &   spirited   grace   is   wanting . Such   a   mask   indeed   is   far   preferable   to   a   bad   picture . Most   translators   who   profess   to   imitate ,   do   in   fact   only mimick   their   original ;   they   catch   some   peculiarity   &   heighten it   to   caracatura   .   When   I   know   that   no   Poet   can   write   in the   true   spirit   of   Dryden ,   Cowley ,   or   Shakespear ,   tho   they   have the   use   of   the   same   language ,   I   am   a   little   incredulous as   to   their   being   able   to   hit   that   je   ne   scai   quoi   ,   so   delicate , so   unreduceable   to   any   rule   of   art ,   in   a   language   of   a quite   different   turn   &   spirit .   Suppose   I   was were   told   there   was   not a   single   statuary ,   who   could   in   marble   entirely   imitate   a   modern marble   statue   of   Mr   Rysbracks ,   but   that   an   hundred   artists   would   readily undertake   to   make   an   exact   likeness   in   lead   or   silver   of some   ancient   statue   of   gold   or   parian   marble ,   could   I   hope   with great   confidence   for   the   performance   of   this   promise ? I   own   I   was   glad   Mr   Franklyn   undertook     to imitate   Sophocles   only   in   an   elegant   &   chaste   simplicity . The   most   flexible   mind   or   body   can   hardly   mould   itself into   the   exact   form   of   another ,   &   every   attempt   towards it   will   have   an   air   of   distortion   and   constraint .   I   think those   writings   alone ,   which   I   could   have   known   at   sight   to   be translations ,   have   been   such   as   have   profess'd   to   be   rather imitations   than   translations ,   and   to   follow   closer   the   spirit than   letter   of   the   original .   What   these   gentleman   commonly call   the   spirit   of   their   author   is   really   nothing   but   the   idiom   of   his   tongue Whereas   if   they   would   but   consider   that   the   best   way   to imitate ,   is   to   write   those   thoughts   &   sentiments   in   pure ,   elegant , &   natural   english ,   which   their   author   wrote   in   pure ,   elegant , &   natural   Greek ,   or   Latin ,   the   ignorant   reader   would   be   much obliged   to   them .   I   do   not   wonder   that   a   person   of   Mr   Rusts taste   &   learning   should   have   a   superior   admiration   of the   greek   tragedies .   I   have   not   seen   any   thing   of   the dramatick   kind   in   any   language ,   which   take   it   for all   in   all ,   seems   to   me   at   all   equal   to   Sophocles   plays even   through   the   dull   medium   of   translation .   As   the perfection   of   writing   consists   not   so   much   in   shining passages ,   as   in   the   total   perfection   of   a   work ,   the   best &   surest   applause   is   the   unwearied   attention   of   the reader .   false False   thoughts   &   grotesque   ornaments   may   please &   surprize ,   but   it   is   only   the   just ,   the   natural ,   &   the proper ,   that   can   engage .   The   mob   indeed   are   attracted by   the   exhibition   of   monsters ,   &   prodigies ,   &   foreign rarities ,   but   the   judicious   specatator   is   to   be   fix d   by the   regular ,   beautifull ,   &   orderly   productions .   Your   Lordships favorite   tragedy   of   Philoctetes   tho   it   is   very   barren   of events ,   proves   itself   the   mastership piece   of   art   by   the   constant attention   it   commands .   I   think   if   all   I   possess   was   at the   hazard   of   a   trial   at   law ,   I   should   not   listen   to   the   pleaders with   greater   attention   &   interest   than   I   did   to   Neoptolemus , Ulysses ,   &   Philoctetes   litigating   for   the   arrows . One   wonders   how   it   will   end .   The   honest ,   generous   & frank   character   of   Neoptolemus   makes   one   under little   apprehension   he   should   use   force   or   fraud ,   to   a   miserable man   who   has   trusted   him ,   Ulysses   has   all   his   wanted subtilty   &   art ,   but   what   is   cunning   when   understood ? Treachery ,   ill   usage ,   severe   suffering ,   despair ,   and and   solitude   have   render'd   Philoctetes   suspicious ,   resentful , &   inflexible .   his   mind   like   his   cave   is   rude ,   forlorn ,   and almost   inaccessible :   he   will   not   listen   to   human   councils or   perswasion .   A   deity   is   wanted   to   untye   the   knott ,   but Philoctetes   abandon'd   by   all   the   Gods   will   obey   none of   them ,   despair   is   impious .   What   can   be   done   then ?   why , let   his   Hero ,   his   benefactor ,   his   deify'd   friend   appear .   He comes ,   untyes   ye   knott   without   breaking   any   of   the   strong   threads of   which   it   was   composed .   That   the   difficulty   &   distresses arose   merely   from   the   personal   characters   of   those   concernd , without   any   external   impediment   &   are   removed   without violating   those   characters ,   is   most   singularly   beautifull . The   tragedy   of   Ajax   seems   to   me   to   fall   far   short   of the   other .   Ulysses   is   not   there   directed   by   Minerva ,   but Minerva   seems   to   act   by   the   counsels   of   Ulysses   &   divine   wisdom is   turn'd   into   human   cunning .   The   minute   description of   Ajax   killing   &   quartering   sheep   is   abominable .   the story   would   pass   in   light   narration ,   as   in   Homer ,   but dwelt   upon ,   circumstantiated ,   &   as   it   were   represented ,   it deviates   into   the   comick .   The   behaviour   of   the   Atridiae is   barbarous   &   brutal ;   like   a   they   act   like   tyrants   over   their   savage subjects ,   not   like   chiefs   of   an   army   of   Heroes .   Tho   I   admire Athenian   art ,   I   have   not   lost   my   esteem   for   the   native genius   of   Shakespear ;   he   alone ,   like   the   Dervise   in the   arabian   tales ,   can   throw   his   soul   into   the   body   of another   man ;   feel   all   his   sentiments ,   perform   his function ,   &   fill   his   place .   Must   not   one   have   been   in King   Lears   situation ,   who   had   injured   one   daughter &   been   offended   by   another ,   have   feard   the   worlds   censure for   imprudent   generosity ,   &   dreaded   losing   all   the   tender pleasures   of   paternal   love   before   one   could   have   thought of   falling   on   ones   knees   to   ones   child   to   beseech   her   to   be dutifull .   How   without   having   incurr'd   the   guilt   of   murder did   he   so   far   feel   the   remorse   that   attends   it ,   as   to   know   that after   having   done   such   an   act   when   the   grooms   cry   God   bless   us Macbeth   could   not   say   Amen ,   &   that   his   crime   being   so   recent he   was   scarce   acquainted   with   the   nature   &   measure of   his   offence ,   he   should   make   him   ask   himself   wherefore could   I   not   say   Amen ?   Every   passing   sentiment   is   caught by   this   great   genius ;   every   shade   of   passion ,   every   gradation of   thought   is   mark'd .   In   the   famous   soliloquy ,   To   be   or   not   to be ?   how   naturaly naturally   do   all   the   questions   arise ,   &   how   finely   are those   circumstances   set   forth   which   are   most   grievous ,   to   the discontented   mind !   The   insolence   of   office ,   the   rich   mans contumely ,   the   laws   delay ,   the   thousand   scorns   that   patient merit   from   the   unworthy   take ,   these   are   the   grievances   a splenatick   mind   complains   of .   It   is   not   the   anguish   or   ye   fear   of   bodily   diseases that   prompts   the   desperate   hand   of   selfmurder ,   it   is   gloomy pride   &   discontent   at   the   offenses   offer'd   by   fellow   creatures that   drive   the   soul   to   sullen   desperation .   When   Macbeth intimates   to   his   wife ,   that   he   is   about   something   with   which he   will   not   acquaint   her ,   you   see   his   words   are   full of   the   dark   &   bloody   purpose   of   a   midnight   murderer ,   & he   considers   the   night   only   as   an   accomplice .   How   finely does   King   John   prepare   us   for   the   command   he   is   going to   give   to   Hubert ?   My   paper   would   not   hold   all   the remarks   one   might   make   on   King   Lears   addresses   to   the   storm &   return   of   thought   to   his   daughters ,   &   the   workings   of   a   wounded mind   till   by   degrees   madness   is   brought   on .   In   his   Hamlet , K:   John ,   Henry   ye   Fourth ,   &   all   his   good   plays ,   he   makes his   person   say   what   one   would   imagine   could   not   occur to   any   one   who   was   not   in   their   very   circumstances . I   imagine   that   being   an   actor   might   a   little   assist   him in   this   respect ;   the   writer   puts   down   what   he   imagines ,   the actor   what   he   feels ,   the   characters   &   situations   are   in   some degree   realized   in   the   acting .   Had   Shakespear   lived in   Sophocles   age   &   country   what   a   writer   had   he   been What   powers   had   he   by   nature ,   &   alas !   what   deficiencies in   art !   Genius   alone   cannot   attain   the   perfection   of composition ,   but   it   can   snatch   a   grace   beyond   the   reach of   art   .   I   must   observe   too   that   the   moral   reflections   of Shakespear   are   not   the   cold   &   formal   observations   of   a Spectator ,   but   come   warm   from   the   heart   of   an   interested person .   How   natural   are   those   made   by   Wolsey   on   his disgrace !   The   same   things   out   of   the   mouths   of   the chorus   would   lose   much   of   their   force   &   their   grace   & wear   too   great   an   appearance   of   commonplace   observations . But   I   ask   pardon   for   troubling   your   Lordship   with what   if   it   is   just   you   must   have   observed   before ,   if it   is   not ,   is   unworthy   of   your   attention .   I   am   actually an   Inhabitant   of   Newcastle ,   &   am   taking   out   my   freedom , not   out   of   a   gold   box ,   but   by   entering   all   the diversions   of   the   place .   I   was   at   a   musical   entertainment yesterday   morning ,   at   a   Concert   last   night ,   at   a musical   entertainment   this   morning .   I   have   bespoken a   play   for   to   morrow   night ,   &   I   shall   go   to   a   ball   on chusing   a   Mayor   on   monday   night .   The   people   are very   obliging   &   desirous   to   amuse   me ,   &   I   could   never understand   Master   Shallows   dignity   of   being   very proud   &   very   melancholly ,   &   so   I   endeavour   to   seem diverted   at   least   as   I   am   in   good   health .   I   could   spend my   time   very   happily   with   my   books .   More   leisure   & fewer   acres   had   possibly   made   me   happier ,   but   my business   is   to   make   the   best   of   things   as   they   are .   I   am not   much   alarm'd   at   the   report   of   Emin ,   it   may   be   an old   lye   or   a   new   one .   The   Bishop   of   Ossory   &   Dr   Gregory left   us   on   monday .   My   complimts   attend   all   my   friends at   Hagley .   Your   Lordship   will   be   glad   to   hear   we   are to   have   more   Highland   poetry . With   unalterable   regard I   am   your   Lordships most   obliged   &   Obedient Humble   Servant E   Montagu The   post   which   is   just   come   in has   brought   me   a   letter   from Mrs   Pitt ,   in   which   she   tells me   there   is   news   that   Mr Emin   is   alive   &   well . 
BC_1760_EMONTAGU_GL_2	Weatherby tuesday   night Nov   ye   My   Lord I   had   the   favour   of   your   Lordships   most   obliging &   friendly   letter   the   night   before   I   left   Newcastle   but   I   was too   much   embarass'd   with   the   ceremony   of   taking   leave to   have   leisure   to   answer   it .   I   am   now   set   down   to   write   after a   journey   of     miles   through   the   roughest   roads   in   the gloomiest   day   in   the   dreariest   month   of   the   year ,   your Lordship   will   not   be   surprized   if   I   am   a   little   dull but   you   will   not   be   sorry   for   it   when   I   tell   you   I enjoy   that   degree   of   ease   &   health   which   most   dull people   possess .   My   journey   has   done   me   service ,   &   the   pain in   my   face   is   surprizingly   relieved   since   I   set   out .   My Nerves   are   always   a   little   flutter'd   with   a   long   journey , but   I   do   not   feel   any   weariness   &   if   we   have   not any   hasty   &   violent   rains   to   swell   the   river   at Newark   I   hope   to   be   in   Town   the   day   after   you receive   this ,   viz   on   saturday   ye   .   I   approve   much   of your   Lordships   prudence   in   not   going   to   the   Kings funeral ,   it   is   a   ceremony   for   those   who   wish   to   catch a   cold   rather   than   for   one   who   wants   to   get   rid of   one .   I   am   sorry   you   begin   the   winter   so   ill ,   but I   hope   change   of   air   at   Clewer   may   carry   off   your cough .   I   write   this   letter   from   Weatherby ,   the   description of   which   tho   far   inferior   to   the   place   pleased   you enough   to   make   you   determine   to   see   it   if   you   was ever   in   the   Neighbourhood ,   but   I   beg   that   your   Lordship will   take   care   that   your   visit   hither   be   in summer ,   for   if   you   were   to   come   to   it   in   November I   should   be   as   much   disgraced   as   a   Beau   of   the last   century   would   be ,   who   from   youthfull   remembrance should   recommend   Mrs   Dunsk   to   his   friends   as   a toast .   The   rocks   which   were   adorn'd   &   soften'd   by   the trees   &   pendant   branches ,   now   look   more   horrid   &   forlorn from   the   dry   stumps   &   naked   arms   of   the   trees ;   the crystal   stream   on   which   the   sun   beams   play'd   is   now a   muddy   river   reflecting   a   dark   sky .   the   brisk   &   lively current   seems   increased   to   rage ;   &   threatens   the   vale it   chear'd ;   nor   is   there   one   amiable   circumstance remaining   of   the   whole   but   a   larger   stone   bridge which   well   defends   you   from   the   dangers   beneath . What   do   people   mean   who   say   they   are   so   fond of   the   Country   they   love   it   in   winter ?   would   it not   be   just   as   reasonable   to   say   one   was   so   fond of   beauty   one   loved   Mrs   Dunsk   in   her   old   age I   never   saw   any   winter   scene   which   I   could   much admire   but   at   Richmond   in   Yorkshire   which   in summer   it   is   fine ,   but   it   wants   softness ,   &   its   character leans   to   the   terrible .   I   happen'd   to   be   there   once   when   it was   in   the   highest   perfection   &   it   was   truly   sublime , mix'd   as   Mr   Burke   desires ,   with   horror .   I   stood   in a   high   bank   in   Mr   Yorks   garden   opposite   a   great   black Mountain   while   the   swale   roll'd   down   in   vast   billows , such   as   you   see   when   the   sea   is   in   a   storm ,   but there ,   they   have   room ,   here   they   were   so   confined that   their   agitation   is   not   to   be   imagined ,   one billow   still   breaking   over   another ;   great   branches of   trees   &   other   things   which   the   torrent   had swept   in   its   rapid   course ,   shew'd   that   its   menaces were   not   always   vain ,   &   Richmond   castle ,   tho   made   a ruin   by   the   gentle   hand   of   time ,   by   the   turn of   the   prospect   look'd   as   if   it   had   been   the   victim of   this   omnipotent   torrent .   the   hurry   of   the   people in   the   village   to   remove   their   cattle   out   of   the   course of   the   impetuous   flood ,   the   loud   &   hollow   whistling of   the   wind   &   the   rustling   of   hail   &   rain   above   ones head ,   join'd   to   the   roaring   torrent   below ,   made   such   a crash   of   elements   as   would   have   pleased   the   grim   power who   frown'd   on   paradise   &   man   in   bliss .   I   will   own   this was   a   fine   spectacle ,   but   such   as   only   a   Demon   could delight   to   see   often ,   so   that   I   did   not   envy   Mr   York his   garden ,   tho   he   assured   me   with   an   air   of   triumph   that   they   had   many   such storms   in   the   course   of   the   winter . I   am   mortified   not   to   be   in   Town   to   hear   the   solemn tollings   of   the   bells   &   ye   discharge   of   the   cannon   at the   time   of   his   Majesties   funeral ,   indeed   I   should   have wish'd   to   have   seen   the   ceremony ,   for   gravity   heightens pomp ,   gay   processions   appear   less   noble .   I   am   glad to   find   his   empty   coffers   clear   him   of   the   imputation of   avarice .   I   think   Sr   Richard   who   is   the   successor   of Dukes ,   &   the   Predecessor   of   Princes   has   reason   to   carry his   head   so   high .   I   received   all   ye   packets   your Lordship   mentions ,   &   beg   my   best   thanks   &   compts to   his   excellency   the   Governor . I   shall   not   be   in   Town   on   saturday   till   it   is pretty   late .   I   shall   hope   to   hear   a   good   account   of your   Lordships   health ,   &   that   you   will   call   on   me on   saturday   evening   as   soon   as   suits   your   leisure . I   am   with   the   greatest   regard   your   Lordships most   Obliged   &   faithfull Humble   Servt E M 
BC_1760_EMONTAGU_GL_3	Tunbridge   Wells   ye     of   aug. My   Lord , If   I   had   not   been   very   apprehensive that   your   Lordship   was   threaten'd   with   a   severe   fit   of the   rheumatism ,   I   should   not   so   placidly   have   received an   account   of   your   being   still   rheumatick ;   but   one   shade of   evil   lighter   than   our   fears   have   painted   seems   a   kind of   blessing .   I   hope   Dr   Monseys   medicine   will   entirely cure   your   complaint   but   I   lament   this   damp   weather   as   too   likely to   bring   it   back .   I   cannot   yet   boast   of   any   great   benefit from   the   Tunbridge   waters .   A   bad   lodging ,   a   disagreable system   of   life ,   &   a   great   fright   from   the   danger   I   was   in of   such   an   overturn   in   my   coach   as   would   probably have   been   fatal ,   has   kept   me   much   in   the   same state   I   was   when   I   came   hither .   I   have   rested   better   lately but   not   well .   I   do   not   with   your   Lordship   accuse   the vivacity   of   my   imagination   of   this   insomnie ,   for I   remember ,   that   when   my   mind   was   more   lively , more   diligent ,   incessantly   forming   landskips   or   history peices ,   real   portraits ,   or   grotesque   forms ,   it   used   to   sleep eight   or   ten   hours   without   even   the   visitation   of a   dream ,   &   rose   in   the   morning   like   Aurora ,   throwing freshness   and   joy   on   every   object ,   tricked   itself   out   in sun   beams ,   &   set   in   gay   &   glowing   colours .   If   any   person had   then   advertised   for   a   companion   to   travel   thro the   desarts   of   Siberia   or   Africa ,   I   could   have   recommended My   imagination   to   them   as   one   which   would   shew   Cities   where even   a   cottage   did   not   appear ,   or   like   Moses   wand   would bring   a   river   from   a   rock .   It   was   from   this   picture   drawing faculty   I   used   to   be   always   amused   &   gay ,   &   when   first fancy   began   to   lose   some   of   its   creative   powers   it   retaind the   complaisance   of   Hamlets   courtier ,   &   could   trace a   weezel   or   an   Elephant   in   a   shapeless   cloud   from   the least   hint   that   was   given   it .   But   from   a   painter   this poor   mind   is   sunk   into   meer   journal   writer ,   &   barely repeats   matter   of   fact ,   &   the   event   of   the   day ,   &   yet it   cannot   sleep   over   the   dull   story   in   black   &   white ,   as it   did   on   the   gay ,   illuminated ,   fairy   tale . I   do   not   wonder   that   Lady   Lincolds   acquaintance   should be   shock'd   at   her   death ,   it   is   only   while   one   took   at Holbeins   picture   that   one   couples   this   King   of   terrors   with such   gay   &   youthfull   characters .   I   think   Death   seems   of   late   to   be grown   an   ,   &   to   feed   on   peafowl   &   singing   birds , so   that   we   ordinary   domestick   beings   may   hope   to   be neglected   by   him .   I   hear   he   yet   spares   the   Phoenix Coventry ,   &   that   she   is   relieved   by   the   breaking   of   an imposthume . I   have   lived   so   entirely   alone   that   it   has   not   been possible   for   me   to   spare   my   poor   eyes ,   I   have   made them   read   many   hours   every   day .   I   got   from   the   booksellers here   a   volume   of   the   new   translation   of   Sophocles ,   which I   had   with   great   pleasure ;   or   if   it   be   a   greater compliment   to   Melpomene ,   I   may   almost   as   properly say   with   great   pain ;   &   indeed   with   an   interest   and eagerness   that   is   not   be   described ,   &   which   was   probably In   part   owing   to   the   veneration   to   a   great   name The   OEdipus   Coloneus   affected   me   extreamly ,   &   would   have done   so   more   if   it   had   not   been   for   the   constant   presence of   the   Chorus ;   but   the   passions   are   awed   &   checkd by   a   crowd .   I   am   more   than   ever   averse   to   the   chorus because   tho   as   ye   translator   tells   us ,   the   chorusses   of   Sophocles are   less   alien   to   the   subject   of   the   Drama   than   those of   any   other   tragedian ,   &   yet   here   they   hurt   the interest   of   it   very   much .   I   should   not   be   so   much   moved by   the   tender   paternal   chiding   of   Henry   ye   fourth if   his   Majestys   Privy   Counsellors   were   all   on   the stage ,   interrupting   his   expostulations   with   his   son by   a   fine   song   on   paternal   care ,   &   the   mischiefs of   youthfull   indiscretion .   But   after   all ,   I   envy   the Athenians   an   entertainment   so   noble   in   itself ,   so   affecting to   their   state ,   so   glorious   to   their   Country ,   &   honorable to   their   founder   Theseus .   With   respect   to   Sophocles   be   it spoken ,   I   wish   the   play   had   ended   with   the   tragical &   mystical   death   of   OEdipus .   The   supernatural   circumstances that   attend   it   would   have   left   the   mind   in   a state   more   truly   tragic   than   it   is   in   at   ye   conclusion of   his   daughters   lamentations ,   which   tho'   fine   &   pathetick , are   such   as   might   follow   on   the   death   of   any   other Father ,   &   resemble   those   on   taking   leave   of   him .   The Thunder   that   comes   in   as   symphony   to   the   last   act   of Fated   OEdipus ,   his   death   so   supernatural ,   his   body   the pledge   of   empire ,   &   the   place   of   his   burial   unknown to   all   but   Theseus   &   his   successors ,   are   circumstances that   leave   the   mind   in   a   very   peculiar   situation &   I   think   I   would   defy   the   tragick   muse   to   do   any thing   greater .   I   have   not   seen   my   opinion   authorized By   any   critick   or   commentator ,   but   I   shall   know   whether it   is   right   or   not   when   your   Lordship   tells   me   yours . I   have   not   heard   whether   Mr   Hall   received   the four   setts   of   dressing   boxes   I   sent   from   hence   as your   Lordship   desired .   At   the   same   time   I   took   ye liberty   to   send   you   a   cheap   set   of   tea   cups   &   coffee cups   for   a   Tunbridge   faring .   I   directed   the   boxes   to Mr   Hall ,   &   sent   him   a   note   by   Dr   Monsey .   being   at that   time   in   want   of   franks .   &   therefore   enclosed   to the   Doctor . I   am   very   happy   in   being   so   much   in   your   Sons favour ,   I   shall   not   forfeit   my   interest   by   negligence   , I   shall   hope   to   hear   sometimes   how   the   Sunning   waters agree   with   your   lordship   I   dare   say   I   shall   get   well now   I   have   a   room   to   breathe   in ,   but   the   smallness of   my   lodgings   suffocated   me .   We   have   had   a deluge   of   rain .   With   the   most   perfect   regard I   am   my   Lord your   Lordships   /   most   Obliged   &   faithfull   /   Hble   Servt   /   E   Montagu How   is   Lord   Egremont ?   I   hope   well enough   to   visit   Hagley . 
BC_1760_EMONTAGU_MB	Hillstreet   thursday Madam I   have   enclosed   the   Bishop   of   Londons letter ,   which   I   beg   of   your   Grace   to   keep   till   you   have a   leisure   hour   in   which   I   may   receive   it   from   your hands   either   here   or   at   Whitehall ;   in   the   mean   time be   assured   I   am   perfectly   satisfied   as   to   the   letters being   safe ,   &   shall   not   wish   to   have   it   return'd   till it   is   most   convenient   to   your   Grace   to   pay   me   for any   pleasure   it   may   have   given   you ,   by   that   I shall   have   in   its   procuring   me   an   hour   of   your company .   I   think   indeed   the   letter   will   afford   you a   good   deal   of   pleasure ,   it   must   be   a   great   comfort to   every   good   mind   to   see   how   religion   can   impart not   only   patience   but   even   chearfullness   under the   greatest   bodily   infirmities .   I   find   it   will   be necessary   to   trouble   your   Grace   with   some   explanation of   the   Bishops   letter .   Before   I   went   to   Tunbridge   I   sent   his Lordship   the   Highland   poems   by   the   Dean   of   York ,   & the   day   before   I   went   to   Tunbridge   my   Lord   sent   them back   with   a   very   obliging   note   to   thank   me   for   them , but   express'd   his   opinion   that   they   were   not genuine .   I   was   a   little   distress'd   by   this   favour ,   as I   had   not   an   opportunity   of   waiting   on   the   Bishop before   my   journey .   I   thought   to   write   to   him ,   &   assume the   air   of   being   his   correspondent   would   have too   much   appearance   of   presumption ,   &   not   to thank   him   for   his   note   might   look   like   neglect ,   so   I waited   till   the   season   allow'd   him me   to   send   him some   wheatears ,   &   to   assure   him   I   wrote   only   as   his Poulterer ,   As   it   was   natural   to   take   notice   of   what his   Lordship   had   said   concerning   the   poems ,   I ventured   with   the   utmost   deference   to   give   the reasons   why   I   should   have   believed   them   to   be genuine   &   original ,   &   then   return'd   back   to   my character   of   Poulterer ,   &   desir'd   his   Lordship   to forgive   my   presumption   and   order   my   letter   to be   put   on   ye   wheatears   when   roasting   to   preserve them   from   being   burnt .   I   ask   pardon   for   this   long story ,   but   it   was   necessary   as   a   key   to   the Bishops   letter   Your   Grace   will   find   some   mistakes made   by   his   secretary . I   was   misinform'd   the   other   night   when   I   told your   Grace   Mr   W:   Montagu   was   gone   abroad , he   is   in   England ,   but   where ,   is   a   secret   even   to his   lawyer ,   &   those   who   are   imploy'd   in   his   affairs . I   thought   it   right   to   let   your   Grace   know   this , as   it   appears   to   me   very   singular ,   as   he   is   now under   the   protection   of   privilege .   I   know   you   will be   so   good   as   not   to   mention   I   told   your   Grace this   unless   it   be   to   Lady   Bute ,   who   I   should   think had   better   know   this   circumstance .   I   beg   my   best respects   to   my   Lord   Duke   &   Lady   Harriet   Bentinck . With  the  greatest  gratitude  &  regard regard I  am  Madam Your  Graces Most  Obliged  Most  Obedt and  faithfull  humble  Servt E:  Montagu 
BC_1760_EMONTAGU_MR	"Newcastle   ye   Sir I   arrived   here   last   night ,   &   had   the   pleasure of   finding   Mr   Montagu   very   well .   He   went   this   morning   to Gibside   to   this   morning   to   attend   Mr   Bowes   funeral   obsequies , which   according   to   the   custom   of   this   Country   are   to   be   very pompous .   Ld   Ravensworth ,   Sr   Walter   Blackett ,   &   all   the   Gentleman of   Northumberland   &   the   County   of   Durham   are   to be   at   it ,   &   I   fear   it   will   be   late   at   night   before   it   is   over , tho   they   are   to   set   out   about     from   Gibside   to   go   to   the Church   but   such   a   number   of   Equipage   must   make   the ceremony   at   procession   very   tedious .   My   Cousin   Rogers   funeral which we   had   order'd   to   be   as   private   as   decency   would   permit as   he   had   been   so   long   dead   to   society ,   but   even   that   was attended   by     Gentlemens   coaches ,   so   I   suppose   a   publick funeral   must   be   three   or   four   hundred .   In   the   south   people live   with   more   pomp   &   dye   with   less .   I   hope   not   to   outlive   all my   vanity ,   for   I   have   seldom   seen   a   good ,   &   never   an agreable   character   without   it ,   but   I   think   it   should   not survive   one ,   &   I   should   desire   not   to   go   to   the   Grave   with all   this   bustle ,   not   that   I   should   be   afraid   any   one   should say   of   my   funeral   as   Pope   does   of   Sir   John   Cutlers When   dead   a   thousand   lights   attend The   wretch   who   living   sav'd   a   candle's   end .   I   love   a   blaze of   wax   lights   &   my   friends   about   my   living   person   very well ,   but   ye   torches   &   the   Croud   about   my   dead   body would   give   me   neither   light   nor   amusement .   Sir   Walter Blacket   call'd   here   this   morning   &   said   he   hoped   to ride   in   Hyde   Park   with   you   about   ye     of   November . I   had   a   very   pleasant   journey ,   for   fine   weather   like   a   good humour'd   companion   makes   ordinary   scenes   appear chearfull   &   pleasant ,   but   from   the   time   I   left   Hertfordshire till   I   got   to   Doncaster   the   countries   I   pass'd   through were   dreary   &   barren ,   but   if   these   prospects   in   ye   other countries   were   brown ,   these   in   Northumberland   are   black , our   Towns   &   villages   seem   the   habitations   of   poverty ,   & the   people   in   them   a   parcel   of   dirty   savages ,   so   that I   cannot   say   with   the   Psalmist ,   that   my   lot   is   fallen in   a   fair   ground ;   it   is   some   comfort   it   is   in   a   rich   one &   I   shall   see   its   produce   at   Sr   James   Colebrookes   in Threadneedle   street   with   great   pleasure .   Our   Town   of   Newcastle is   the   ugliest   City   in   Great   Brittain ,   but   full   of   wealth &   business ,   the   streets   are   like   ye   ways   of   thrift ;   dark , dirty ,   &   narrow .   I   met   Sr   Thomas   Clavering   just   before   I got   to   Darlington ,   he   desired   me   to   present   his   best   respects to   you   and   beg   your   vote   &   interest ,   he   sets   up   for   the   County of   Durham   in   the   room   of   Mr   Bowes .   Mr   Montagu   gives him   all   his   interest .   If   the   Bishop   of   Durham   should   declare for   Mr   Shaftoe   ( a   very   young   man   whose   father   formerly Served   for   Durham )   Sr   Thomas   will   be   hard   press d . Lord   Darlington   will   support   Mr   Shaftoe ,   and   most people   imagine   the   Bishop   of   Durham   will   do   so   too . When   applied   to   for   Sr   Thomas   Clavering   he   answerd he   should   act   as   he   found   most   agreable   to   the   majority of   the   Country   Gentlemen ,   now   I   imagine   Bishops   as well   as   well   as   Women   ( both   wear   petticoats   and   a   character of   gentleness )   command   by   seeming   to   submit , "" and   win   their   way   by   yielding   to   the   tyde "" &   that   my   Lord   Bishop   in   a   mild   way   of   suggestion will   bring   the   Gentlemen   to   that   side   he   likes   best ,   while he   perswades   them   he   follows   their   inclination .   I   must say   his   Lordship   is   much   beloved   from   his   liberality &   affability ,   which   are   fine   moral   qualities ,   as   to   Xtian graces   no   doubt   but   he   has   them   still   in   a   higher degree ;   so   that   as   Prince   Palatine   or   Bishop   he   must   influence many .   The   Dean   of   Durham   is   strongly   engaged   for Sr   Thomas ,   and   there   will   be   a   sort   of   schism   in   the church .   I   wish'd   for   your   company   very   much   yesterday at   Durham   where   I   dined ,   the   rain   that   fell   the   night before   prevented   my   going   to   Bishop   Auckland   which I   intended   to   have   seen   in   my   way   to   Newcastle ,   but   as The   ground   was   damp   I   could   not   have   walk'd   about   it . I   shall   send   you   some   potted   moorgame   by   the   first opportunity .   We   are   to   have   our   Steward   &   people   of   business here   to   morrow .   I   design   to   sit   every   day   as   the   house of   Commons   does   for   dispatch   of   business ,   for   I   shall   wish its   conclusion   &   our   return   to   London ,   to   which   this   Town resembles   in   nothing   but   smoke ;   I   am   in   an   exceeding good   house   which   was   ye   late   Mr   Rogers ,   &   Mr   Montagu gave   in   part   of   ye   purchase   of   an   estate   he   bought of   Mr   Isaacson ,   the   good   folks   are   very   obliging ,   &   live   neatly &   well ;   &   I   hope   to   pass   my   time   more   quietly   &   with   much less   hurry   &   bustle   than   if   I   was   at   a   house   of   my own   where   all   the   neighbourhood   must   visit   me . I   am   Dear   Sir Your   most   affectionate and   most   dutifull   Daughter E   Montagu "
BC_1760_EMONTAGU_SS_1	Hillstreet   ye   . My   Dearest   Sister I   found   your   letter   yesterday   at   my return   to   Hillstreet .   If   I   had   known   some   days   sooner of   your   being   at   Witney   I   would   have   met   you there ,   trusting   to   a   good   welcome   from   ye   Dean &   Mrs   Freind   I   wd   have   taken   that   road   to   ye North ,   &   have   borrow d   some   days   from   my waterdrinking   scheme ,   I   am   now   bound   by promise   to   Mr   Montagu   to   set   out   from   hence directly   and   dare   not   put   so   much   delay   into my   journey .   I   will   own   I   took   it   into   consideration even   this   morning ,   inquired   ye   distance ,   goodness of   roads   & c ,   found   myself   in   danger   of   breaking my   faith   to   my   Consort   from   weakness   within &   force   of   external   temptations ,   but   considering I   should   trespass   on   Mr   Montagu's   expectations near   a   week   I   gave   up   my   scheme   tho   it still   lies   fluttering   at   my   heart .   It   really   grieves me   beyond   expression   to   lose   my   annual   pleasure of   seeing   you .   by   the   by   this   carrying   a   coalsack is   as   bad   as   carrying   a   knapsack ,   &   alack a   day   that   I   should   be   quarterd   at   Newcastle ! I   who   would   never   go   out   of   ye   bills   of   mortality but   to   see   you   &   some   particular friends .   I   am   come   to   Town   fat ,   rosy ,   nay   they tell   me   quite   a   blowzelinda .   I   feel   upon   leaving Tunbridge   as   if   I   waked   out   of   a   delirious dream ,   &   indeed   I   am   glad   it   is   over ,   for   I   hate that   sort   of   idleness   in   which   there   is   so much   ado   about   nothing .   I   believe   that for   this   last   fornight   I   have   shewn   our Tunbridge   folks   that   I   have   not   been learning   greek   .   Je   me   suis   diverti   moult tristement   on   ye   walks ,   in   ye   rooms ,   at ye   Balls .   I   shall   write   to   you   again   next post   for   I   must   make   this   a   brief   epistle I   brought     letters   in   my   letter   case   yesterday in   order   to   answer   them   by   to   days   post .   I found   six   letters   at   my   arrival   all   wanting answers ,   think   how   this   &   my   preparation for   my   Northern   expedition   must   hurry me .   Dr   Monsey   is   now   sitting   by   me with   a   face   of   impatience   but   he   shall wait   till   I   have   desired   my   compts   to   the Dear   Mrs   Freind   &   Miss   Freind .   I   have   sent you   a   translation   of   some   poems   from   ye   old Erse   language   in   which   you   will find   ye   noblest   spirit   of   poetry .   I   shall set   out   for   ye   North   on   friday   at   latest . Monsey   sends   his   tender   sighs   to   you . I   am   my   Dearest   Sister Ever   yrs E M 
BC_1760_EMONTAGU_SS_2	Tuesday  Hillstreet My  Dr  Sister I  came  to  Town  last  night ,  rejoyced  to  be  free from  my  Tunbridge  Captivity ,  &  little  less  pleased  at  the  being so  may  miles  nearer  to  you ,  which  mends  the  prospect tho  it  has  not  much  influence  on  the  objects  that  surround me ,  but  you  know  the  human  mind  looks  beyond  the  present time  &  place .  I  have  had  a  lives  of  philosophers  &  beaux  esprits this  morning ,  you  know  my  Cortege  is  not  made  up  of  pretty Men .  I  have  brought  a  stock  of  health  from  Tunbridge which  will  be  worth  something  to  me  at  London ,  Bath Easton ,  &  Sandleford ,  while  I  was  at  Tunbridge  I  suffer d mortification  in  hopes  of  my  reward  in  a  better  place as  the  good  often  do  in  this  World ,  for  in  the  sauntering way  one  lives  at  Tunbridge  it  is  no  matter  whether  one is  sick  wel or  well ,  one  lives  but  a  kind  of  as  it  were . I  drank  the  waters  at  the  Well  yesterday  morning  & was  in  Hillstreet  by  dinner .  I  have  not  yet  seen  my Father ,  I  sent  him  word  I  was  come  to  Town  but  Mr Montagu  thought  it  wd  be  bad  managemt  to  go this  morning  as  my  Coach  does  not  come  till  tomorrow Otherwise  I  had  gone  to  him  to  day .  I  hope  he  sent  a  proper answer  to  ye  letter  I  sent  him ,  &  that  you  have  received it  before  this  time .  Adieu  my  Dear  Sister  I  must  go  &  renew my  acquaintance  with  my  Drawers ,  buroes  & c ,  &  begin the  business  of  unpacking . I  am ever  most  affectly  yrs E M I  desire  my  compts to  Lady  Bab  &  Miss Arnold  I  hope  her  Ladyship is  better  than  when  I  had the  honor  of  her  letter  which I  design  to  answer  as  soon as  I  can  hear  how  the World  goes . 
BC_1760_EMONTAGU_SS_3	ye   I   think   it   an   age   since   I   have heard   from   my   Dear   Sister   &   am   the   more uneasy   as   I   fear   her   own   illness   or   Lady Babs   may   have   occasion d   her   silence .   My Brother   William   told   me   he   gave   you   an account   of   his   happy   proceeding   with   ye Lady   of   his   affections .   She   dined   here   one day   &   I   met   her   at   my   Fathers   at dinner ,   &   I   was   to   have   dined   at   her house ,   but   I   was   not   able   being   much indisposed   &   feverish .   I   think   she   seems sensible ,   &   good   natured ,   she   has   not   ye Cestus   for   a   girdle   nor   have   the   Graces Fashion'd   her .   Her   Brother   seems   a   sensible misanthrope ,   &   I   believe   is   a   freethinker ;   he has   read   a   good   deal   &   is   a   little   pedantick I   could   almost   wish   by   way   of   amusement ye   family   had   less   merit   &   more   agrémens one   has   such   a   vile   habit   of   loving   what is   agreable .   I   design   however   to   esteem   & respect   my   new   allies   to   ye   highest   degree . Lady   Sandwich   was   with   me   last   night I   think   she   has   look d   better   since   she came   to   Chelsea   than   I   had   seen   her   of a   long   time ,   &   I   hope   her   spirits   are pretty   good .   My   Brother   Morris   &   his family   are   going   to   Sandleford ,   which I   am   very   glad   of ,   for   I   think   it   is   a Good   air   for   ye   sweet   little   man .   William threatens   us   with   a   world   of   nephews &   Neices   &   Mother   Church   is   very   prolifick to   say   ye   truth   I   think   Grace   will   be necessary   to   assist   human   endeavours   in this   case .   My   Brother   Robinson   has   sent a   most   cordial ,   civil ,   friendly ,   Brotherly , fatherly   invitation   to   ye   Lovers   to   come to   Norton ,   for   my   part   I   do   not   perceive an   absolute   necessity   to   love   ones   Sisters in   law   at   first   sight ,   but   Mr   Matt: Robinson   does   every   thing   by   system , &   it   is   in   his   system   to   shew   regards to   kindred   in   a   supreme   degree .   As   Mr William   &   I   did   not   visit   before   this treaty   of   marriage   I   shall   go   on   doucement   . I   waited   on   ye   dame   ye   day   after   he Acquainted   me   with   ye   affair   &   invited her   to   dinner .   I   have   not   askd   them   to visit   me   at   Tunbridge   because   Lovers   love solitude   shady   Groves   &   parting   streams . William   was   in   high   spirits   at   first ,   I think   he   seems   now   not   unreasonably in   love ,   but   on   ye   whole   satisfied   &   easy , &   if   she   can   keep   ye   thermometer   of   his affections   at   temperate   heat   she   will   be well   off .   The   Missy   gave   me   twenty   metaphysical reasons   for   her   marrying   my Brother ;   I   am   not   one   of   Bishop   Berkeleys disciples ,   &   do   not   ( especially   in   love   affairs ) annihilate   matter   &   make   room   for   spirit , &   in   this   match   I   am   a   materialist , certain   atoms   arranged   into   a   particular form   of   countenance   seem   to   me   to   have done   ye   business   &   much   good   may   his His   sweet   countenance   do   her .   She   hangs over   him   with   looks   of   cordial   love   enamourd . Mr   Montagu   is   so   angry   at   ye   poor   youth for   marrying   a   Woman   with   so   little beauty   I   believe   if   he   was   his   son   he wd   disinherit   him .   You   wd   dye   with laughing   if   you   was   to   hear   him Mr   Montagu   express his   astonishment   &   disdain ,   &   when   I   laugh at   what   he   says   he   concludes ,   I   wish   it may   end   well .   I   endeavour   in   vain   to convince   him   that   a   handsome   wife is   not   one   of   ye   necessities   of   life ,   &   when I   have   mollified   him   as   to   ye   face   he begins   on   ye   shape .   Charles   seems   to   be glad   it   is   not   his   affair .   My   Father   has utter d   at   least   a   hundred   bon   mots on   ye   occasion ,   &   Morris   looks   as   amazed As   if   he   had   seen   a   ghost .   I   could   wish Miss   Richardson   did   not   dress   with   so much   fancy ,   th'   adorning   her   with   so   much   art is   but   a   barbarous   skill She   has   as   many   beads   in   her   dress as   a   Nabobs   wife ,   pink   coppets   &   all ye   prettiness   of   a   beauty   in   her   teens . I   wish   she   had   more   ye   air   of   a   Gentlewoman . or   if   not   that ,   a   decent   kind   of   a   grogram figure   fit   for   a   parsons   wife .   but   one should   rather   take   her   for   ye   wife   of a   ribbon   weaver .   I   believe   I   was   such   a brute   as   not   to   mention   in   my   last how   glad   I   shd   be   if   ye   asses   at Sandleford   cd   be   of   ye   least   use ,   if they   were   not   any   of   them   in   proper order   when   you   sent   pray   let   them come   as   soon   as   they   are .   I   desire   to Know   whether   Miss   Crosby   has received   her   things .   I   have   got   her Brother   appointed   Carpenter   to   ye Blest   Sloop   which   please   to   let   her know   &   also   be   so   good   as   to   pay her   for   ye   carriage   of   her   things for   me .   &   I   shd   be   glad   to   hear   she has   got   them .   Here   I   was   interrupted   by   ye ignoble   distress   of   ye   Kitchen   chimneys   taking   fire but   it   is   extinguish'd   &   all   is   well .   You   will   soon receive   Rapins   history .   I   beg   my   best   respects   to   Lady Bab   &   love   to   Miss   Arnold . I   am My   Dearest   Sister Ever   most   affectly   yrs E M 
BC_1760_EMONTAGU_WP_1	My   Lord Your   Lordship   could   not   be   more   disappointed than   I   was   at   Ld   P-s   not   coming   to   us ,   as   I   am   sure   your own   heart   does   not   more   earnestly   or   anxiously   desire   whatever can   be   for   your   happiness   than   mine   does ;   but   I   must   beg   that you   do   not   chide   my   Lord   P-   for   not   coming ,   for   fear   it should   pique   him ,   &   perhaps   make   him   look   hereafter   on the   lady   thro   the   gloom   of   chagrin .   I   was   much   pleased with   every   thing   she   said   during   the   evening .   She   seems perfectly   unaffected ,   a   little   timid   but   not   awkwardly bashfull ,   &   I   should   imagine   she   has   a   more   than   ordinary share   of   good   sense .   Every   good   quality   I   see   in   her   gives   me double   pleasure ,   as   it   is   an   equal   security   you   will   love   her &   she   will   love   &   honour   you .   The   meeting   which   has   faild   here I   will   soon   bring   on   at   Mrs   Veseys ,   we   will   settle   the   manner whenever   I   can   have   an   opportunity   of   speaking   to   your   Lordship . If   you   think   the   meeting   will   appear   more   natural   I   will assemble   a   number   of   card   tables   for   that   purpose ,   as   I cannot   again   very   soon   make   a   more   private   meeting , without   appearing   to   court   the     family   in a   manner   which   will   seem   singular   if   Ld   P:   not   liking the   lady   it   should   never   be   explain'd .   I   hope   your   Lordship did   not   increase   your   cold .   I   applaud   my   self   much ,   that   from an   apprehension   your   Lordship   might   sit   near   the   window , I   had   carefully   stuff'd   every   crevice   of   it   before   you   came . Pray   don't   vex   at   the   disappointment ,   I   will   sacrifice every   delicacy   to   get   these   young   people   to   meet   when   ever you   please .   If   I   can   be   the   means   of   adding   to   your   happiness it   will   make   me   amends   for   spasms   in   the   stomach   &   ten thousand   pains   of   the   head   &   heart .   It   is   a   great   happiness to   me   that   you   have   a   son   in   whom   you   may   so   justly   take pride   &   pleasure .   A   man   of   ordinary   merit   would   not   have pass'd   well   through   the   World   with   a   name   to   which   you have   given   so   much   lustre ,   &   tho   the   comparison   with   his Father   would   have   hurt   him   less   in   your   opinion   than in   that   of   any   other   person ,   you   would   have   been   mortified at   the   immense   inequality .   I   hope   in   a   grandson   the   grandfather will   appear   in   full   perfection ,   and   that   you   &   I   shall   live to   see   his   virtues   blossom   in   spite   of   the   melancholly   language   you talk'd   to   me   last   monday   night .   I   flatter   myself   your   Lordship   was   as   much mistaken   when   you   complain'd   of   decay   of   health   as   I   am   sure you   was   when   you   talk'd   of   the   failure   of   your   mental   faculties it   was   happy   for   me   you   join'd   them   together ,   as   my   confidence   in the   latter ,   guarded   me   a   good   deal   against   the   apprehensions of   the   former ,   but   let   me   know   how   you   do   to   day .   Your   Lordship order'd   me   to   tell   you   how   the   pain   in   my   eye   is   this   morning . I   think   it   is   not   so   bad   as   it   was   yesterday   morning ,   nor   so well   as   in   the   evening .   I   suppose   I   shall   get   well   as   soon   as   the weather   permits   me   to   take   more   air   &   exercise   &   not   till   then . I   have   sent   your   Lordship   Mr   Diderots   comedy   which   I   hope will   amuse   from   its   novelty .   A   new   muse   like   a   new   mistress may   please   better   than   one   more   charming   but   less   new ,   if   mens heads   are   as   fickle   as   their   hearts .   I   think   I   told   your   Lordship that   Mrs   Vesey   desired   the   honour   of   yr   company   on   sunday evening .   If   the   weather   does   not   permit   your   Lordship   to   go   out of   Town   on   monday ,   you   had   the   goodness   to   promise   to   pass   the evening   here .   Lord   Lyttelton   desired   me   to   engage   your   Lordship to   his   house   on   tuesday   evening   but   I   hope   you   will   disappoint us   all   by   going   into   the   Country   for   your   hoarseness   begins to   alarm   me   how   is   it   today ?   Did   you   ever   drink   seltzer   water for   a   cough ?   It   is   very   pleasant   with   Rhenish ,   &   admirable for   all   disorders   of   the   lungs ,   the   best   is   to   be   had   at   Mr Yager's   an   apothecary   in   Arlington   Street ,   when   taken   without wine   the   cold   should   be   just   taken   off .   Your   Lordship   will   be so   good   as   to   order   yrservant   when   he   brings   me   an   account of   yr   health   ( which   is   all   the   answer   you   need   take   the trouble   to   give   to   this   long   scrawl )   to   stay   for   some   Moorgame . I   am My   Lord Your   most   Obliged   & c E M 
BC_1760_EMONTAGU_WP_2	My   Lord I   have   sent   your   Lordship   back   the Bishop   of   Londons   letter ,   which   cannot   be   more   honourably placed   than   in   your   cabinet .   From   an   apprehension that   this   letter   may   be   degraded   by   appearing   in   a magazine   of   chronicle   I   was   desirous   to   communicate it   to   my   friends   under   such   restraints   as   would   secure me   from   blame   in   case   such   of   accident . As   I   do   not   expect   a   billet   doux   every   morning ,   I   was unluckily   asleep   ( observe   that   I   do   not   say   not   dreaming of   my   Lord   Bath )   when   your   letter   arrived .   I   cannot express   how   much   I   admire   your   Lordships   parody of   a   Bishops   pastoral   letter .   As   I   have   yet   got   but half   way   towards   the   ardors   of   fourscore ,   your   Lordship will   not   expect   I   should   immediately   comply   with your   proposal ;   but   if   you   will   be   content   with   a sentimental   love   till   I   arrive   at   the   tender   age   of   eighty , a   person   &   a   passion   so   ripen'd   by   time   must   be   very yielding .   And   according   to   the   latest   reckoning   of   the learned   and   ingenious   Mr   Whiston ,   the   Millenium   will then   commence ,   so   that   we   may   have   a   proper   period in   which   to   prove   our   constancy   &   love ,   &   at   a   moderate computation ,   may   produce   a   thousand   of   those   proofs of   it ,   which   your   Lordship   seems   to   think   the   best testimony .   I   am   now   very   much ,   but   at   the   commencement of   the   next   century   hope   to   be   entirely Yours . I   hope   your   Lordship   will   not forget   your   engagement   on sunday ,   for   I   have   been   interrupted in   my   letter   by   a   visit   from a   very   pretty   man   of   five   &   twenty , whose   conversation   is   so   far   from the   spirit   of   your   Lordships   letter , that   I   cannot   but   be   tired   of   ye insipidity   of   these   young   people . 
BC_1760_EMONTAGU_WP_3	Past   eleven   saturday morn - My   Lord I   thank   your   Lordship   much   for your   game ,   &   still   more   for   your   letter .   &   I   can   justify that   taste   upon   the   best   principles   of   Epicureanism . I   really   think   I   cannot   be   too   much   upon   my guard   against   a   Lover   who   at   once   strikes   off   twenty years   in   his   suit ,   such   vehemence   &   violence   alarms me ,   had   your   Lordship   begged   off   ye   twenty   years by   five   years   at   a   time ,   I   really   think   you   had prevail'd .   You   say   my   Lord   that   at   the   end   of forty   years   I   promise   only   to   listen .   I   appeal   to your   own   experience   &   the   report   of   others ,   whether ever   the   Woman   who   listen'd   to   a   Lover   only listen'd   .   However   I   forgive   your   Lordship   this mistake   for   the   justness   which   you   place   all   pride and   vanity   in   love   conquests   on   the   male   side . As   to   Dr   Monsey ,   I   have   reason   to   hope   he   has   already broke   his   heart .   Mr   Montagu   lives   in   that   state   of ignorance   from   whence   arises   much   of   the   felicity of   the   conjugal   state ,   &   I   am   willing   he   should live   till   the   millennium   draws   a   little   nearer ,   I am   very   sensible   that   happy   period   comes   nearer every   day ,   by   the   increasing   tenderness   with which   I   am My   Lord Your   Lordships most   devoted 
BC_1760_EMONTAGU_WP_4	My   Lord Of   what   elements   can   your   Lordship   be   composed that   neither   pain   nor   my   troublesome   enquiries   about   that pain   can   disturb   the   harmony   of   your   temper !   I   am   rejoyced some   of   your   enemys   forces   are   fled   but   till   all   are   dislodged one   cannot   be   at   ease   about   you .   Thank   God   your   Lordship took   the   opiate   last   night ,   &   I   hope   your   apozem   this morning   will   do   service .   The   opiates   operate   towards   a perfect   cure   as   well   as   give   a   temporary   relief .   I   admire your   charming   spirits ,   &   I   hope   they   will   communicate some   joy   to   me   when   I   see   your   Lordship   at   seven .   I   should be   angry   with   any   other   person   who   could   be   so   unconcerned when   my   Lord   Bath   is   sick ,   but   patience   is   the   best anodyne ,   &   I   know   you   will   get   through   your   illness by   its   assistance .   I   cannot   express   my   sense   of   your   Lordships goodness   in   writing   to   me ,   but   I   fear   it   gave   you   trouble . Your   mind   seems   to   be   set   to   the   tune   of   the   musick of   the   spheres ,   I   cannot   at   present   write   a   song that   will   go   well   to   unjarring   musick   so   Adieu   ! Heaven   bless   you   &   give   you   health .   I   shall   then   be   happy , I   am   always yrs   & c 
BC_1760_EMONTAGU_WP_5	My   Lord I   have   made   use   of   a   silver   eel   from   the River   Kennet   as   Gentleman   usher   to   my   letter ,   but   I   protest he   is   rather   the   excuse   than   the   reason   of   my   writing   for   I   love to   tell   your   Lordship   how   much   joy   &   pleasure   I   am   in   your debt ,   on   account   of   the   great   praise   I   heard   of   Lord   Pulteneys speech   in   the   H:   of   Commons   yesterday   on   the   affair   of   the prize   money .   I   suppd   at   Mrs   Veseys ,   where   my   Lord   Lyttelton said   every   thing   that   could   be   said   of   Lord   Pulteneys   eloquence , &   what   will   please   you   more ,   of   the   noble   generosity   of   his sentiments .   Lord   Lyttelton   intends   to   call   on   your   Lordship this   morning ,   but   perhaps   you   will   think   what   he   says to   you   on   the   subject ,   may   have   a   strain   of   compliment ; but   indeed   I   believe   he   will   express   him   self   with   more   moderation to   your   Lordship   than   he   did   to   us ,   as   I   am   sure   from   the superiority   of   your   reason   you   will   listen   to   it   with   more   moderate   joy   than I   did .   Your   Lordship   has   often   known   the   too   tender   sensibility of   my   heart   make   me   unhappy ,   but   on   any   event   that   can give   pleasure   to   you ,   I   feel   the   same   excess   of   joy .   It   may   seem strange   that   my   Lord   Pulteney ,   who   I   never   saw   in   my   life has   given   me   more   happy   &   unhappy   hours   than   most   of my   dearest   friends .   Mrs   Carter   is   pretty   well   to   day ,   &   if   your Lordship   likes   it ,   we   may   as   well   drink   tea   with   you as   give   you   the   trouble   of   coming   hither ,   &   if   the   weather should   be   less   severe   your   Lordship   may   return   our   visit tomorrow   evening .   On   saturday   &   sunday   I   am   engaged . I   am   not   afraid   of   going   out   this   cold   weather .   I   was   last night   at   Alexanders   Feast ,   your   Lordships   conversation is   a   much   better   feast ,   &   I   protest   I   honour   you   more   than   I should   Alexander   were   he   alive   on   the   Throne   of   Persia . The   house   was   so   cold   last   night   I   shall   take   care   of the   Oratorios   till   the   weather   changes .   Doctor   Monsey   supp'd   at Mrs   Veseys ,   he   was   in   great   spirits ,   &   told   me   your   Lordship was   well ,   which   I   was   glad   to   hear ,   for   I   imagined   the   stars that   shone   on   the   D:   of   Clevelands   birth   might   be inauspicious   to   my   Lord   Bath ,   as   you   certainly   differ   more from   each   other   than   any   two   persons   in   the   creation .   Pray be   carefull   of   yourself ,   &   let   me   preserve   the   good   spirits , good   humour   &   good   health   I   enjoy   at   present .   I   hope your   Lordship   will   let   us   come   to   you ,   for   the   fear   of   your getting   cold   will   make   a   little   cloud   in   the   sun   shine   of   my mind ,   there   are   few   days   in   a   year   in   which   one   so sensible   to   its   friends   is   quite   without   a   vapour .   I   am My   Lord Yr   most   Obliged   & c E M: 
BC_1761_EMONTAGU_EC_1	ye   I   believe   the   melancholly   articles in   the   papers   relating   to   Admiral   Boscawen   would make   my   Dear   Mrs   Carter   apprehend   why   I   have not   answers   her   letter ,   a   letter   too ,   which   had   so interesting   an   article   as   that   of   her   coming   to Town .   My   heart   felt   all   the   joy   upon   it   that   it was   capable   of   under   the   sad   circumstance   of seeing   one   of   the   best   of   Women   &   dearest   of   my friends   made   most   unhappy   by   the   loss   of   a Husband   she   loved   with   the   greatest   tenderness &   admired   to   a   degree   of   enthusiasm .   This   great man   snatch'd   away   with   all   his   blushing honours   thick   upon   him ,   in   the   noon   of   life   & glory   must   be   a   striking   object   to   every   thinking mind ,   but   to   me   who   lived   constantly   in   view of   his   widows   sorrows   &   his   childrens   tears it   must   be   deeply   affecting .   Her   behaviour   on This   as   well   as   all   other   occasions   has   been   very noble   &   very   tender ;   at   first   she   was   the   dumb statue   of   grief ,   she   hardly   knew   more   than   the marble   figure   that   in   a   mournfull   attitude bends   over   a   tomb ,   in   a   day   or   two   tears   began to   flow ,   she   pray'd ,   she   wish d ,   she   tried   to   be   resignd acknowledged   her   duty   but   found   it   almost past   her   power ;   the   humility   of   her   sorrow   has engaged   the   mercifull   protector   of   his   creatures to   support   her   beyond   all   human   hopes   under her   condition ,   &   tho   she   will   probably   never   again be   the   lively   happy   Woman   she   was ,   yet   I   see she   will   be   able   to   go   through   the   duties   of a   double   Parent   to   her   children .   One   of   the   greatest joys   I   had ,   was   in   seeing   her   as   happy   as the   condition   of   human   life   will   allow ,   her prosperities   &   pleasures   I   had   in   a   manner appropriated   &   I   have   now   for   many   weeks   been paying   interest   for   my   borrow'd   joys .   She   sees   no one   but   Lady   F   Williams   Lady   Smythe   &   my   self besides   Mr   Boscawens   family   &   her   own   Father So   that   I   have   been   with   her   as   much   as   my health   would   allow ,   and   thank   God   I   have   been but   little   interrupted   by   illness ,   tho'   the   agitation I   felt   during   ye   Adls   long   sickness   &   ye   shock of   ye   sad   event   at   last   reduced   me   low .   I   am now   much   better   in   ye   main ,   tho   I   had   so   bad a   pain   in   my   head   this   afternoon   I   was   forced to   go   to   bed   at   six   o'clock ,   however   warm   tea &   a   nap   refresh d   me ,   &   I   am   now   sitting   up in   bed   to   write   this .   I   long   to   see   you   in   Town .   I sent   yr   letter   to   Mrs   Norman   immediately .   I   hope you   will   find   benefit   by   coming   to   Town .   I   wish I   was   sure   of   it   as   that   your   friends   will .   I am   with   the   most   tender   affection   &   esteem   my Dear   Mrs   Carters Most   faithfull   &   Obliged E M 
BC_1761_EMONTAGU_EC_2	Ealing   friday   May     Dear   Madam You   left   London   only   this   morning &   I   am   writing   to   you   to   night ,   does   it   not   seem   unreasonable ? I   hope   not ,   as   you   must   know   there   are   habits which   it   is   hard   to   break ,   &   alass   I   was   in   the habitude   of   conversing   with   you   every   day .   I   feel   like a   traveller ,   who   by   the   chearfull   light   of   the   sun   has pleasantly   persued   his   days   journey ,   but   seeing   it   below   the horizon ,   enjoys ,   &   would   fain   prolong   the   twilight   which tho   it   has   not   the   warmth   &   lustre   of   the   noonday yet   is   a   kind   interposition   between   it   &   the   gloom of   night :   This   faint   &   distant   conversation   by   letter keeps   up   an   intercourse ,   &   I   fancy   I   am   not   quite separated   from   my   Dear   friend   while   I   am   thus corresponding   with   her .   I   came   to   Ealing   this morning ,   imagining   I   should   hear   your   tones   better from   the   nightingale   than   in   the   din   &   chatter   of London   conversation .   If   I   could   think   you   happy I   could   regret   your   loss   with   a   pleasing   sensibility but   when   I   consider   all   your   spirits   &   health may   suffer   there   is   grief   &   terror   in   my   reflections I   shall   go   to   Town   to   morrow   that   I   may   pass   ye   evening with   Mrs   Boscawen   who   gets   that   night   into her   new   house ,   she   will   be   too   apt   to   reflect   on the   change   of   her   condition   upon   such   an occasion ,   &   the   less   time   she   has   to   dwell   on the   subject   the   better .   Alass !   how   few   people   are there   so   happily   situated   that   they   can   intrepidly look   on   their   condition !   Pray   let   me   hear   how   your cold   &   hoarseness   is ,   &   your   state   of   health   &   spirits , Mr   Melmoth   made   me   a   visit   this   evening I   exhorted   him   to   hive   his   leisure   hours   to   the publick   &   hope   he   will   do   it   as   his   health   is now   much   improved .   My   best   complements   attend all   your   family ,   You   know   how   I   am   interested for   them   so   pray   always   mention   them   & every   thing   that   concerns   them .   I   long   to hear   that   Miss   Molly   Carter   has   recoverd her   cold   &   that   ye   dear   little   man   continues   to mend   more   than   words   can   express   I   am yours   E M 
BC_1761_EMONTAGU_EC_3	Sandleford june   ye     Dear   Madam I   told   you   in   my   last   that   I   was   going to   take   a   flight   into   Berkshire ;   &   here   I   have   been   ever since   Friday   evening ,   leading   a   pastoral   life   in   the finest   weather   I   ever   saw .   Tho   the   most   sage   Horace says   we   change   our   climate   without   changing   our disposition ,   I   must   be   of   another   opinion ,   for   by   only by   the   difference   of   latitude   &   longitude   between   Hillstreet and   Sandleford ,   I   am   become   one   of   the   most   reasonable , quiet ,   good   kind   of   Country   Gentlewomen   that   ever was .   In   the   days   when   misses   employ'd   their   crimping &   wimpling   irons   upon   cheesecakes   &   tarts   not   on   flounces   &   furbelows   &   Matrons used   no   rouge ,   but   a   little   cochineal   to   give   a   fine colour   to   a   dry'd   neats   tongue ;   they   could   not   be further   from   the   temper   qualities   &   conditions   of   a   fine Lady   than   your   humble   Servant   at   this   present writing .   My   health   is   much   improved   by   the   country air ,   I   saunter   all   day ,   &   when   Phœbus   sets   in   the   material   World   he   rises   in   the   intellectual ;   then   I sit   down   to   read   what   he   has   inspired   &   I   find The   amusements   of   the   day   here   prepare   me   well   for   my evenings   lecture .   At   this   season   the   whole   scenery   of the   Country   is   poetical ,   every   Hill   is   Parnassus ,   for   there the   Muses   sit ;   &   every   stream   pours   Helicon ;   to   all   indeed is   not   given   the   piety   of   the   head ,   but   certainly   all feel   it   at   the   heart ,   &   the   pleasures   of   a   fine   summers day   give   a   joy   more   sublime ,   more   elegant ,   &   more harmonious ,   than   any   thing   else ,   other   pleasures are   plain ,   domestick ,   &   prosaick ;   not   so   gently   flowing , or   so   sweet .   The   mention   of   Poetry   puts   me   in   mind to   tell   you   I   am   very   well   satisfied   with   ye   share of   praise   you   give   to   Cowley .   He   had   a   rich   vein   of thought ,   but   being   too   ostentatious   of   it   we   are disgusted   at   the   proud   display   of   his   treasures :   as at   the   pomp   of   a   rich   man ,   when   it   goes   beyond the   bounds   modesty   &   a   sound   judgment   should   set   to   it . I   agree   with   you   that   his   love   verses   are   insufferable I   think   you   &   I   who   have   never   been   in   love ,   could   describe it   better ,   were   we   ask'd   what   is   it   like   ?   I   think some   of   his   translations   from   Anacreon   very   pretty &   the   verses   by   ye   God   of   love   in   honour   of   Anacreon are   very   pretty ,   tho'   a   little   too   long .   I   think   you   was too   temperate   in   your   commendations   of   la   mort   d'abel . I   was   infinitely   delighted   with   it   as   a   work   of genius .   On   your   recommendation   I   lent   it   to   my   Lord Lyttelton ,   who   sent   it   back   with   great   approbation . but But   to   be   sincere ,   in   spite   of   you   both ,   some   silly prejudices   against   the   Author ,   &   ye   language   ye poem   was   originally   written   in ,   a   little   damped my   expectation ,   &   ye   beginning   in   which   he   imitates Milton ,   with   all   ye   faintness   of   reflected   beams , made   me   advance   very   soberly .   But   what   a   feast is   the   patriarchal   dinner ?   How   sweetly   innocent their   manners !   Eves   horror   at   ye   first   storm , her   surprise   at   Adams   fastening   up   ye   mouth of   the   cave ,   concern   at   the   first   sight   of death ,   which   is   finely   supposed   to   seize   a   dove ,   because in   that   animal   only   could   ye   grief   of   a   surviving friend   be   shewn .   with   ten   thousand   other   circumstances in   hers   &   Adams   narration   are   all   so natural   &   yet   so   new   that   I   must   call   Mr   Gesner a   Poet .   A   poet   should   create ,   but   he   should   not make   Monsters ,   I   think   our   author   has   not   the sublime   but   his   genius   suits   his   subject .   What a   noble   piety   !   what   a   purity   of   heart   in   Abel !   & how   finely   is   his   characted character   contrasted   with   Cains . Abels   are   virtues   of   disposition   &   temper   in   a   great degree ,   &   so   are   Cains     vices ,   which   is   rightly imagined   in   a   state   of   life   where   example   and discipline   could   not   have   so   much   influence   as in   larger   society   . &   more   mix'd   life .   Miltons   &   Mr   Gesners pastoral   scenes   are   so   enobled   &   refined   by   religion that   the   Shepherds   &   shepherdesses   who   worship the   wanton   Pan   &   drunken   Silenus   make a   mean   figure   when   compared   to   them .   I   agree with   you   in   liking   Mr   Gesners   pastorals   extreamly , but   let   him   still   keep   to   the   more   than   ye   golden age   of   ye   poets .   I   wd   fain   propose   to   him   to   take ye   story   of   joseph'   next .   He   has   a   fine   genius   for Drama ;   the   last   three   books   of   Abel   make   a noble   tragedy .   Did   not   you   drop   a   tear   at   the   lamentation of   Cains   children   over   Abels   body ?   Il   ne   se reveillera   plus !   Il   ne   se   reveillera   plus !   How simple !   how   natural !   how   affecting !   What   a   witchcraft is   there   in   words ?   repeat ,   il   est   mort   ,   it   is   nothing , but   the   symplicity   of   ye   children   who   had   not a   name   for   death ,   &   ye   words   at   once   signifying   ye circumstance   is   very   touching .   I   desire   you   wd   permit Abel   to   stay   with   you   for   if   you   had   been   born at   ye   same   time   I   should   have   taken   you   for twins .   I   have   taken   a   House   at   Tunbridge   from   the   of   July   &   I   hope   my   dear   Friend   will   be   ready   to   come to   me I   wish   I   could   give   you   a   better   account   of   Lady Frances   Williams ,   but   she   is   inconsolable .   Mrs Boscawen   is   now   at   Mrs   Southwells   where   I was   ask'd   to   be ,   but   I   wish'd   Mr   Montagu   to take   ye   benefit   of   air   &   exercise   here ,   &   he   is vastly   the   better   for   it ,   &   much   mended   since you   saw   him .   We   have   not   fix'd   our   day   for going   to   London   but   it   will   be   on   Saturday   or   Monday I   believe .   I   have   taken   a   House   at   Tunbridge from   ye     of   july .   I   hope   my   Dear   friend   will be   ready   to   come   to   me .   Pray   write   to   Dr   Monsey , for   if   you   are   very   feverish   his   pills   may be   too   hot .   I   desire   a   particular   account   of   yr health ,   &   of   your   invalids ,   who   I   hope   by   virtue of   fine   weather   no   longer   deserve   to   be   call d   so I   shall   send   ye   post   chaise   to   you   as   soon   as   I   am   at   Tunbridge I   am   my   dear   Madam with   most   sincere   &   tender   affection yrs   E:Montagu please   to   direct to   Hillsteet 
BC_1761_EMONTAGU_EC_4	I   am   much   alarm'd   at   not   hearing from   my   Dear   Mrs   Carter   to   day .   I   hope   it   is owing   to   some   fault   in   ye   post ,   but   cannot make   myself   easy   in   that   thought ,   as   nothing less   than   a   perfect   assurance   of   your health   &   safety   can   make   my   heart   feel any   quiet   my   mind   is   too   full   of   this   subject to   write   on   any   other .

BC_1761_EMONTAGU_ED	Thursday My   dearest I   believe   it   will   be   agreable   to you   to   hear   that   Lord   Sandwich   call'd   on   me   this morning   to   desire   me   to   write   you   word   that   he   hopes that   the   second   week   in   february   you   will   be   ready   for Huntingdon .   his   Lordship   says   he   will   give   you   only two   days   trouble ,   one   to   canvass   another   to   be   elected . You   may   believe   I   received   his   Lordship   with   all   respect &   he   seemd   in   very   good   humour .   I   hope   in   this easy   way   you   will   not   dislike   being   rechosen the   times   seem   to   be   such   as   an   honest   man   may take   pleasure   in .

BC_1761_EMONTAGU_EV	Sandleford   Oct   My   Dear   Mrs   Veseys   account   of   herself   gave me   great   concern ,   &   tho   I   rather   disswaded   her   applying   to   Mr Galin ,   yet ,   if   the   pain   of   the   teeth   continues   so   grievous   &   violent , I   think   it   would   better   to   have   recourse   to   him .   I   had   pleased myself   very   much   with   thinking   you   had   seen   the   fine   spectacle of   the   installment   at   Windsor .   You   give   me   a   rich   picture   of what   pass'd   under   your   eye ,   so   I   have   lost   a   great   deal   by your   not   being   present   at   the   whole   ceremony .   I   should   have been   glad   to   have   been   at   Windsor   on   the   occasion .   I   have   a great   respect   for   all   the   institutions   of   chivalry ,   &   a   due reverence   for   the   Gothick   customs ,   as   well   as   the   Gothick   buildings of   our   Ancestors .   They   were   both   adapted   to   the   times .   The   Knights armor   &   the   Castles   battlements   seem   to   us   unnecessary   and uncouth ,   Regular   policy ,   just   goverment ,   &   the   equal   administration of   justice   &   laws ,   have   in   our   happier   days   made all   private   &   particular   defense   useless   ,   but   in   times   of violence   &   injury ,   the   Redresser   of   Wrongs   was   a   respectable character .   The   qualifications   of   a   perfect   Knight   were   valour , liberality ,   Courtesy ,   &   justice ,   &   the   result   of   them   was   to   be   sans peur   &   sans   reproché   . A   certain   ferocity ,   or   at   least ,   inflexibility might   make   these   Knights   appear   better   consider'd   independantly than   as   Citizens   &   subjects ,   but   we   cannot   wish   for   nobler   virtues in   any   individuals ,   only   that   they   were more   disciplined   by the   laws   of   the   community .   I   wish   as   you   do ,   that   my   friends fine   Drama   on   the   institution   of   the   Garter   had   been   performd in   the   occasion .   It   breathes   the   sentiments   of   the   virtuous &   noble   Founder   of   the   order ,   &   our   Queen   would   have   had no   bad   lesson   in   the   speech   Edward   makes   to   his   Philippa . He   sets   forth   by   what   qualities   the   heart   of   a   great   Monarch is   to   be   captivated .   Some   of   the   Odes   are   the   finest   that   can be   imagined ,   &   the   sentiments   &   manners   of   the   bards   most happily   represented .   I   am   sure   Edward   the   third   would   have made   Mr   West   his   poet   laureate   for   having   infused   so much   of   the   virtuous   Spirit   of   Chivalry   into   his   poem His   muse   seems   to   walk   with   the   Plantagenets   into   the Temple   of   fame .   It   gives   me   pain   as   well   as   pleasure   to   take on   this   subject .   I   cannot   help   grieving   when   I   think   of   the friend ,   the   companion ,   the   guide   I   have   lost .   His   fine talents ,   &   his   learning ,   made   the   least   part   of   a   character   form'd not   only   on   the   latter   but   the   spirit   of   christianity .   In his   own   conduct   he   approach d   the   perfection   of   virtue   as near   as   a   human   creature   can   attain   to   it ,   but   was   gentle to   the   faults   of   others ;   he   reproved   to   amend   not   to   punish &   loved   to   teach   by   example .   He   was   chearfull   in   sickness &   pain ,   resigned   in   affliction   &   humble   with   excellencies of   which   any   other   man   would   have   been   proud .   I   am   glad our   Royal   pair   are   so   happy   in   their   tête   à   tête   ;   but   it   is   not amiss   for   a   fond   couple   to   have   other   people   in   their   party , that   if   l'ennui   should   come ,   they   may   accuse   some   stranger of   having   brought   it   into   the   company .   What   a   World   of Sentiment   may   be   exhausted   in   one   winters   evenings conversation !   My   Lord   High   Steward   who   has   regulated all   the   other   expences   should   take   this   prodigality   of   love into   his   consideration .   I   never   knew   the   most   sentimental lovers ,   who   when   they   had   been   married   a   twelvemonth , were   not   reduced   to   play   at   backgammon ,   chess , or   even the   game   of   Goose   in   a   winters   evening   in   the   country I   imagine   his   Majesty   must   have   been   a   very   fine   figure   in his   Robes ,   there   is   a   mixture   of   sweetness   &   dignity   in   his aspect   which   wins   love   &   respect .   I   wish   he   might   often   appear to   his   subjects   on   such   solemnities .   The   respect   due   to   a   King , &   indeed   all   the   virtues   of   loyalty   are   gone   out   of   the   World . Forms   &   ceremonies   help d   to   maintain   them ,   Form   has been   laid   aside   by   the   great ,   but   the   flippancy   &   ribaldry of   their   inferiors   will   force   them   to   take   it   up   again : Any   wretch   who   has   learn'd   to   read   &   write   in   a   charity school ,   &   in   spite   of   Minerva   sets   up   to   live   by   his   witts , defames   by   the   most   impudent   lies   Persons   of   the   highest rank   &   dignity ,   &   attacks   great   characters   with   the   language of   Billingsgate .   Will   not   this   cold   weather   send   you   to London ?   I   think   with   great   pleasure   of   our   meeting   round as   good   sea   coal   fire .   The   Country   is   now   very   cold ,   I   have been   very   well   for   a   month   past ,   but   the   severe   weather gives   me   cramps   &   rhumatisms ,   however   we   shall   not go   to   Town   till   the   meeting   of   the   Parliament .   My   Lord Bath   left   us   a   fortnight   ago ,   he   was   so   good   as   to   stay here   ten   days .   He   was   in   charming   health   &   spirits .   He has   all   in   mirth   that   is   not   folly ,   &   all   in   gayety   that is   not   levity ;   when   he   left   off ,   Dr   Monsey   began ,   so   we   had much   laughing   as   well   as   a   great   deal   of   that   cheerfulness which   is   still   better .   The   Doctor   is   in   love   in   good   earnest   at last ,   He   met   a   nymph   at   a   juglers ,   at   Tunbridge ,   &   by   some legere   de   main   she   stole   his   heart .   Besides   the   wayward   fancies of   a   man   in   love ,   the   Doctor   has   the   whims   of   a   Splenatick valetudinarian .   He   writes   a   love   letter ,   then   he   takes   valerian bolus   &   a   camphire   julep ;   makes   an   encomium   upon   his mistress ,   then   complains   of   a   swimming   in   his   head .   Sick   or well ,   in   love   or   not   in   love ,   he   is   still   the   original   Monsey entertaining   &   good   humour'd .   I   had   a   letter   from   Lord   Lyttelton about   three   weeks   ago .   he   was   very   well   &   very   happy   at Hagley   with   his   Son   &   daughter ,   &   some   very   agreable   ingenious young   men   his   nephew   Mr   Pitt   was   of   the   party .   I   rejoyce that   Lady   Herveys   wishes   are   all   accomplishd .   I   beg   my   best complimts   to   Lady   Primrose   &   Mrs   Hancock .   I   am   Dear   Madam   ever   yrs E   Montagu 
BC_1761_EMONTAGU_SS_1	Sandleford   Friday   ye   of   june My   Dear   Sister I   am   now   many   miles   nearer   to   Bath Easton   than   I   was   a   week   ago ,   but   our   stay   at   Sandleford will   be   so   short   that   I   shall   not   be   able   to   come   to you   till   ye   end   of   august   or   beginning   of   september ,   &   then   please God   to   grant   me   health ,   I   will   not   foil   to   make   you a   visit ,   unless   it   should   be   equally   agreable   to   you   to come   to   Sandleford .   Mr   Montagu   &   I   came   hither   this day   sennight   we   have   had   the   most   delightfull weather   imaginable ,   &   my   health   is   much   mended by   the   country   air .   We   design   to   return   to   Town on   monday   where   I   shall   stay   but   a   few   days &   then   go   to   Tunbridge   for   six   weeks   or   seven perhaps ,   &   ye   rest   of   ye   summer   I   shall   pass   at Sandleford   except   my   excursion   to   Bath   Easton . Mrs   Carter   is   to   come   to   Tunbridge   to   me   as   soon as   I   get   thither ,   &   I   hope   will   stay   ye   while   season with   me .   I   was   so   fortunate   as   to   enjoy   her   company much   longer   in   Town   this   year   than   usual ,   but that   only   makes   me   wish   the   more   to   have   her again .   She   was   not   in   ye   house   with   me   in   Town , preferring   ye   quiet   of   a   lodging   to   herself ,   &   indeed   it wd   not   be   any   delight   to   Mr   Montagu   to   have   her in   the   house ,   tho   he   says   she   wd   be   a   good   sort   of woman ,   if   she   was   not   so   pious   .   My   Lord   Bath   told me   he   was   to   go   to   Bath   on   ye   wenesday   ye   day we   dined   with   him ,   so   on   Tuesday   I   sent   ye   parcell , but   behold   his   Lordship   went   on   ye   monday   to his   house   near   Maidenhead   Bridge ,   &   from   thence to   Bath   on   wenesday .   I   ask   a   thousand   pardons   for not   having   brought   ye   parcell   hither ,   &   I   should   have Sent   it   from   hence   but   you   shall   have   it   carriage paid   as   soon   as   I   get   back ,   happy   if   so   small a   fine   will   attone   for   my   offence   in   not   sending it   sooner .   I   went   to   Hungerford   last   night   in   hopes   of getting   some   trout   to   send   to   you ,   but   they   were   all   so poor   &   little   I   did   not   think   they   deserved   yr   acceptance , but   hope   to   get   some   better .   We   had   a   good   deal   of   lightening the   latter   part   of   our   airing ,   &   the   storm   continued all   night ,   this   morning   wears   a   doubtfull   appearance I   wish   for   the   sake   of   the   farmers ,   &   farmer   Montagu in   particular ,   that   we   may   have   good   weather ,   should   it be   otherwise   as   quiet   &   leisure   are   as   great   novelties to   a   London   Lady   as   roses   &   pinks ,   I   shall   not   suffer any   great   loss .   I   applaud   myself   very   much   for   having prevaild   on   Mr   Montagu   to   make   this   excursion , I   have   enjoy'd   several   days   of   rural   pleasure   in   the utmost   perfection ,   &   certainly   no   artificial   pleasures   can come   up   to   those   nature   offers   to   us !   &   the   distress   of Mrs   Boscawen ,   &   poor   Lady   Frances   Williams   made me   wish   to   get   into   quite   a   new   scene .   Thank   God Mrs   Boscawen   seems   rather   less   depress'd ,   her   children have   been   ill   &   I   think   in   the   whole   it   has   been   of use   to   her ,   taking   her   thoughts   a   little   off   the   deceased to   the   living .   Her   eldest   son   &   her   daughters   have   behavd with   the   greatest   attention   &   tenderness   I   ever   saw ,   the girls   have   both   been   ill ,   &   also   her   little   boy ,   but are   pretty   well .   Mrs   Southwell   desired   me   to   meet Mrs   Boscawen   at   Westhrope   this   week ,   but   I   could not   do   it .   I   shall   have   Mrs   Boscawen   for   my Neighbour   at   Tunbridge ,   she   is   to   be   at   Sr   Sydney Smyther   only   three   miles   from   the   Wells .   Lady   F   Williams is   in   the   deepest   affliction   for   Lady   Coningesbye .   To   shew the   last   respect   to   her ,   Lady   Frances   staid   in   the house   with   the   dead   body   in   spite   of   all   her   friends could   do ,   she   did   not   leave   Lady   Coningesbyes   house till   last   saturday .   She   has   been   so   singularly   unfortunate that   had   she   not   the   strongest   piety   &   the strongest   reason   to   support   her ,   she   must   sink under   the   repeated   strokes   of   affliction .   I   imagine the   most   faithfull   friendship   &   affection   subsisted between   the   sisters ,   their   understandings   were   so   very unequal ,   that   I   cannot   imagine   there   could   be so   much   delight   in   the   commerce   of   conversation as   between   two   sisters   I   remember   at   Horton ,   &   tho good   will   &   kind   offices   will   do   much ,   I   imagine there   must   always   be   a   chasm   where   there   is   a   disparity of   understanding .   If   Mrs   Carter   was   to   hear   me   she would   reprove   me ,   the   qualities   of   the   heart   she   says are   sufficient ,   indeed   I   am   ashamed   sometimes   to   find she   is   less   impatient   of   the   nonsense   of   fools   than I   am ,   I   would   rather   she   should   teach   me   her   humility than   her   greek ,   but   I   fear   more   sense   is   necessary   to   learn the   first   than   the   last .   I   suppose   you   have   read   Dr Hawkesworths   oriental   tales ,   it   is   not   written   with so   much   spirit   as   the   oriental   tales   in   the   adventurers   which   were   by   him but   there   are   some   fine   things   in   it ,   &   it   breathes the   spirit   of   virtue ,   so   does   more   honour   to   the   Author , &   service   to   the   reader ,   than   the   finest   compositions where   religion   &   morals   receive   offense .   I   design to   send   you ,   if   it   is   to   be   bought ,   which   it   was   not when   I   left   London ,   a   sort   of   Epic   poem   translated   from High   dutch   into   french   prose .   Methinks   I   hear   you   cry dear   Sister   do   you   fancy   I   will   read   high   dutch poetry   humbled   &   mumbled   into   prose ?   I   answer ,   yes Sister ,   you   shall   read ,   &   will   read   it ,   &   like   it   too   &   perhaps weep   at   it   also ,   but   for   that   I   leave   you   at   yr liberty ,   but   I   defy   you   not   to   like   it .   When   I   say   a sort   of   Epic   poem ,   you   are   not   to   think   Eneids   & Iliads ,   Gerusalemme   liberata   & c ,   it   is   a   simple   story from   the   Patriarchal   ages ,   Good   Father   Adam ,   &   Good Mother   Eve ,   Cain   &   Abel   &   their   wives   &   children   are   ye   Drammatis   personæ .   My Author   has   not   the   sublimity   of   Miller ,   but   he   has ye   purity   of   thought ,   the   spirit   of   piety ,   &   the   tender benevolence   of   an   angel .   The   title   of   ye   Poem   &   its catastrophe   is   la   mort   d'Abel .   Perhaps   I   am   to   partial of to   it ,   but   it   seems   to   me   to   have   a   greater   vein of   poetry ,   more   originality   &   simplicity   than   any thing   I   have   seen   a   great   while .   I   will   not   say   any more   of   it ,   for   it   will   say   better   for   itself .   I   have subscribed   to   the   Epick   Hegleland   poem   for   you ,   of which   I   was   shewn   one   entire   canto ,   &   great   part of   another ,   &   think   it   may   stand   on   ye   shelf with   ye   great   epick   poems .   I   have   heard   my   Lord Bath   speak   with   great   regard   of   you   &   Lady   Bab Montagu .   I   believe   we   shall   call   on   him   on   monday in   our   way   to   London ,   we   were   ask'd   to   dine   or   to lye   there   in   our   journey   down   &   at   our   return .   He has   recoverd   his   health   & v   spirits   &   is   the   most delightfull   companion   imaginable .   &   I   think   he   has great   &   good   qualities ,   &   I   do   not   perceive   the   least of   that   covetousness   which   was   attributed   to   him while   his   wife   lived ,   he   lives   nobly ,   entertains generously ,   &   I   know   many   acts   of   generosity   he has   done ,   &   I   have   known   them   from   the   report   & acknowledgments   of   ye   Persons   obliged ,   for   by   his behaviour   to   such   of   them   as   I   have   seen   at   his house ,   you   would   think   he   had   received   favours from   them ,   which   nobly   enhances   ye   benefit .   He seems   to   have   the   strongest   sense   of   religion   &   on   all Occasions   to   shew   it   without   ye   ostentation   of   one   who   wants to   be   praised   for   piety ,   nor   does   he   ever   in   the   gayest of   his   conversation   forget   the   respect   due   to   religion ,   & the   regards   due   to   every   moral   duty .   It   would   give one   pain   to   discover   any   faults   in   one   who   has such   extraordinary   perfections   &   endownments ,   &   I think   his   Lordship   has   outlives   the   errors   into which   the   bustling   of   a   mighty   spirit   may   in youth   have   led   him .   As   to   his   Consort ,   she   was   in Miltons   phrase ,   a   cleaving   mischief   in   his   way   to   virtue . I   am     glad   Lord   Bath   is   to   be   at   Tunbridge ,   Mrs Carter   is   a   great   favourite   with   him ,   &   I   hope   have   a   good   deal   of   his   company .   I   shall   hear   Lady   Bab   makes   a   constant   progress   towards health ,   it   was   unlucky   she   got   cold   at   returning   to Bath   Easton ,   but   change   of   air   often   has   that   effect . I   have   just   had   a   long   letter   from   Mrs   William   Robinson who   writes   very   agreably .   I   had   one   not   very long   before   from   my   Brother   William .   They   are   at Rome   before   this   time . I   am My   Dear   Sister Ever   most   affectly   yours E   Montagu Mr   Montagu   desires   his   love &   respects   I   hope   you   got   my promised   letter . 
BC_1761_EMONTAGU_SS_2	My   Dear   Sister I   am   very   sorry   to   find   your   head aches   have   been   so   frequent   &   troublesome ,   &   cannot help   being   alarm'd   at   the   poor   state   of   your blood ,   on   the   strength   &   vigour   of   which   much of   health   &   duration   of   life   should   seem   to   me to   depend .   let   me   therefore   entreat   you   my dear   Sister ,   not   thus   to   despise   the   admonitions of   the   physician   you   mention .   The   present relief   may   be   attended   with   future   danger , &   I   think   the   case   should   be   proposed   to   the best   physicians   we   have   in   Town .   If   you will   have   it   accurately   written   I   will   shew it   to   Dr   Addlington ,   &   any   other   of   the physicians   of   great   note   you   shall   chuse , D without   expense   or   trouble   to   you ,   &   it   will contribute   much   to   my   ease ,   who   cannot bear   to   think   you   should   lose   ye   immediate benefit   of   bleeding ,   if   ill   consequences   cannot attend   it ,   or   that   you   should   persue   it   if they   may .   Dr   Addington   is   now   much   liked , I   do   not   know   him ,   but   as   he   is   in   great reputation   should   like   that   he   should   be   asked , Duncan ,   Taylor ,   &   Hobberden ,   are   all   in   great credit .   If   they   hesitated   upon   the   matter   I should   be   much   tempted   to   send   ye   case to   Dr   Gregory ,   to   consult   a   Physician   at Edinburgh ,   who   I   believe   is   the   greatest genius   in   Physick   in   Europe .   The   case   seems to   me   a   very   nice   one ,   the   living   on   ye   verge of   a   dropsy   is   horrible ,   my   imagination   is terrified   with   it ,   &   I   must   insist   on   consulting ye   most   skilfull ,   you   shall   be   finally   determined by   your   own   choice ,   but   it   wd   be   a   great relief   to   my   mind   if   I   was   assured   you might   proceed   without   danger ,   &   I   could hardly   be   more   alarm'd   if   you   persisted in   the   practise   contrary   to   their   advice . of   all   distempers   I   have   the   greatest   terrors of   a   dropsey   &   I   fancy   I   see   you   sometimes swell'd   as   big   as   a   hogshead .   There   is   a   Lady here   drinking   ye   Waters   who   is   much   swelld , &   she   is   now   grown   a   terrible   object   to   me . I   am   very   sorry   Mrs   Talbot   whom   I   would   have recommended   as   a   Governess   to   Lady   Harriet Sommerset   is   not   well   qualified   for   teaching french ,   she   seems   a   woman   of   great   merit ,   & her   manners   &   language   are   genteel   &   unaffected . Such   a   place   would   have   made   her   very happy ,   but   from   her   being   little   versed   in the   french   language   I   begin   to   despair of   providing   for   her   in   this   way .   A   few french   words   ill   arranged   &   worse   pronounced , will   often   recommend   an   animal   who   has neither   religion ,   morality ,   nor   behaviour ,   & without   this   abracadabra ,   my   Mrs   Talbot who   has   them   all ,   will   not   effect   any   thing . If   you   know   any   old   Lady   who   does   not want   to   be   taught   how   to   say ,   mouchez   la chandelle ,   &   ouvrez   la   porte ,   I   wish   you   wd recommend   my   sober   virgin   to   attend   her . I   think   your   pretty   damzel   wd   make   a charming   governess ,   but   si   l'amour   maitre Se   meltoit   de   la   partie   she   might   learn a   dangerous   lesson ,   &   tho   too   well   principled in   virtues   book   to   do   bad   things   I   used   to   be always   struggling   with ,   an   unhappy   passion wd     miserable   contest ! Ou   le   combat   est   penible ,   &   le   victoire   honteux I   have   been   at   this   place   three   weeks ,   the Waters   have   been   of   great   service   to   me .   I   never enjoy d   a   more   perfect   state   of   health ,   &   the having   Mrs   Carter   in   my   house   makes me   perfectly   happy .   Mr   Stillingfleet   who   was also   to   have   been   here   with   me ,   but   a   friend of   his   being   in   a   very   bad   state   of   health he   cannot   leave   him .   I   am   in   daily   expectation of   Dr   Young ,   whom   I   desired   to   come in   hopes   I   might   raise   his   spirits   which are   sadly   sunk   by   the   death   of   Mr Rickhardson .   The   Princess   Dowager   not   going to   Rew   the   Doctor   is   not   to   be   in   waiting this   summer ,   so   he   has   written   to   ye   Princess for   leave   to   come   to   Tunbridge ,   &   I   think she   will   not   refuse   it .   We   have   what   is call'd   a   thin   season   here   but   having   some of   my   most   intimate   &   most   agreable friends   here   it   passes   very   well .   Mrs   Carter And   I   are   not   very   fond   of   the   rooms   so   we got   into   our   post   chaise   &   take   ye   air in   the   evening ,   &   we   often   go   to   Bounds to   visit   Mrs   Boscawen .   I   have   some   inclination to   see   the   grand   spectacle   of   a   coronation but   I   find   that   very   compatible   with   seeing   you if   it   is   not   I   shall   give   it   up .   I   wish   of all   things   you   could   come   to   Sandleford ,   which would   be   much   more   agreable   to   Mr   Montagu than   my   going   to   Bath   easton ,   as   he   thinks good   wives   should   not   be   always   from   home . &   I   coulkd   just   return   with   you   &   make   a short   visit   to   Lady   Bab   Montagu   &   Lady Sandwich .   I   did   not   know   Lady   Sandwitch was   at   Chelsea   when   I   wrote   to   you .   She bore   her   loss   better   than   I   expected ,   but looks   thin ,   &   is   not   in   good   health .   She had   an   ugly   pain   in   her   stomach ,   but since   I   came   hither   she   wrote   me word   it   grew   better .   I   certainly   wrote   you two   letters   for   one   I   received ,   if   you   have not   had   the   last   it   may   have perish d   in   ye   oven ,   or   wrapp d   up   figgs or   raisins .   Lady   Frances   Coningesbye   is not   in   good   health   &   her   spirits   are much   affected   by   the   death   of   Lady Coningesbye .   Mr   Bathurst   &   Lady   Beltz are   here ,   she   enquired   after   you . I   shall   be   in   Town   only   one   day   after   ye coronation .   I   hear   there   are   great   disappointments among   the   Ladies ,   above   sixty   having desired   to   be   Ladies   of   ye   Bedchamber &   her   Majesty   wanting   only   six .   As   youth Beauty   address   &   ten   thousand   things seem   to   me   necessary   for   attendance   in to   young   queen   in   a   drawing   room ,   it is   lucky   that   every   Woman   in   ye degree   of   a   Countess   or   Dutchess   should happen   to   have   these   requisites .   Mrs Langton   is   here   in   hopes   of   an   heir   by these   waters ,   which   I   think   an   affront to   ye   prolifick   streams   of   ye   Bath   waters . Lady   Mary   Coke   left   us   to   day ,   not   finding the   waters   agree   with   her ,   she   is   very sensible   &   well   bred   &   a   great   loss   to   our Tunbridge   party .   Mrs   Carter   desires her   best   compts . I   am My   Dearest   Sister most   faithfully   &   affectiontely Yours E   Montagu 
BC_1761_EMONTAGU_WP_1	My   Lord One   prose   line   that   tells   me   my   Lord   Bath   is   well gives   me   more   pleasure   than   the   strains   of   Orpheus   accompanied by   his   Lyre   could   do .   I   will   read   Mr   C-   poem .   I   shall not   feel   any   uneasiness   while   the   modest ,   decent ,   sober translation   of   Ossian ,   whose   sentiments   are   noble   &   simple like   his   language ,   is   abused   by   the   profligate   drunken Poet   .   My   friend   Ramsey   will   receive honour   too   from   his   abuse .   My   cough   is   troublesome   but   not grievous .   Mr   Montagu   had   such   a   fit   of   coughing   at   dinner time   yesterday   he   could   not   even   swallow   a   little   soup , when   it   abated   he   went   to   bed ,   &   he   is   pretty   well   to   day . but   very   imprudently   going   with   Ld   Grevile   Montagu   to introduce   Lord   Curysfort   into   the   House   of   Commons .   He   has   not eat   any   thing   since   yesterday   but   a   bit   of   bread   &   butter   at breakfast   this   morning ,   &   it   is   perfect   distraction   to   go   out , but   I   cannot   help   it .   Poor   Lord   Lyttelton   is   ill   again . 
BC_1761_EMONTAGU_WP_2	Hillstreet Thursday   night My   Lord As   I   cannot   have   the   happiness   of   seeing your   Lordship   to   morrow ,   may   not   I   write   to   you   to   night . Would   it   not   be   ungratefull   if   I   should   not   thanks you   for   all   the   joy   I   have   felt   since   last   saturday ? I   am   to   go   into   the   country   to   morrow ,   very   uncertain whether   the   sun   will   shine   as   long   as   I   stay   there , which   would   be   a   great   misfortune   if   I   went   to   make hay ,   &   would   be   some   damp   to   my   pleasure   even   as I   intend   to   walk   in   the   fields   &   groves ,   if   I   could   not gild   the   scene   by   ye   reflection   of   your   Lordships   felicity . I   dare   say   my   Lord   Pulteney   has   not   intimated   to   your Lordship   the   share   he   has   had   in   the   conquest   we are   so   proud   of ;   but   Fame   rather   provoked   than   restraind by   his   reserves ,   echoes   it   through   the   Town ,   &   I   have   heard the   surrender   of   the   Cittadel   chiefly   attributed   to   his Lordship   spirited   attacks   of   the   redoubts .   The   extraordinary honour   he   has   gain'd   will   pay   your   Lordship   for   all   the uneasy   hours   you   felt   while   the   event   was   doubtfull . May   every   thing   he   undertakes   terminate   in   an   addition of   honour   to   himself   &   of   happiness   to   you !   And   God grant   you   a   long ,   serene ,   &   pleasant   evening ,   to   that   life of   which   the   morning   &   noon   were   so   bright   &   glorious ! Like   the   sun ,   as   long   as   you   are   above   the   horizon ,   you will   give   light   &   life   to   all   around   you .   Your   Lordships counsils   will   assist   your   Sovereign ,   your   wisdom   &   experience direct   &   your   eloquence   animate   your   country   men ,   so   while I   wish   your   Lordship   the   serenity   of   the   evening ,   I   do notfear   your   sinking   into   the   idle   repose   &   the obscurity   of   night .   But   pray   be   carefull   of   your   health , &   let   your   friends   have   the   joy   of   meeting   your Lordship   well   &   happy   at   Tunbridge .   Mr   Montagu has   been   so   good   as   to   say   I   may   go   thither ,   &   I   have engaged   Mr   Morleys   house   from   the   third   of   june . I   have   wrote   your   Lordship   a   very   long   note ,   however you   may   endure   it   with   the   more   patience   as   you was   in   danger   of   having   a   letter   from   me   which was   much   longer ,   but   the   news   of   your   arrival in   Town   stopt   its   going   to   the   post ,   &   my   note   shall not   be   sent   to   Piccadilly   till   I   am   set   out   for Sandleford ,   that   your   Lordship   may   not   have   the trouble   to   answer   it .   Mr   Montagu   &   I   propose   to have   the   honour   of   drinking   a   dish   of   chocolate with   you   in   our   return   to   Town   if   you   are   then at   Ives   place .   With   the   greatest   regard I   am   my   Lord your   most   Obedt   Hble   Sert E:   Montagu 
BC_1761_EMONTAGU_WP_3	My   Lord A   thousand   thanks   for   my   charming   airing yesterday .   It   gave   me   spirits   to   read   till   one   o'clock   in   the morning ,   &   health   to   sleep   from   that   time   till   this   instant , a   most   unreasonable   dose   of   sleep   I   will   confess ,   but   as   my whole   life   is   but   a   dream   I   should   not   much   regret   it ,   if   it was   not   sunday   morning ,   &   I   cannot   be   ready   for   Church .   I   sent to   the   Book   sellers   for   Henry   &   Frances   letters ,   but   by   a   mistake of   Mrs   Donnellans   from   whom   I   had   the   subscriptions   could not   get   them .   I   will   take   care   that   your   Lordship   shall   have them   to   morrow .   I   dare   say   the   generality   of   men   admire Frances's   letters   as   the   virtuosi   do   a   spiders   web ,   surprized that   any   animal   can   spin   so   fine   a   thread ,   &   fancying   some blundering ,   buzzing ,   great   flesh   fly ,   will   break   through   all this   delicate   texture .   But   you   will   find   sentiment   &   delicacy triumph   at   last ,   &   Mr   Henry   becomes   very   platonick .   I   think her   letters   extreamly   pretty ,   more   tender   than   the   pride   of the   Fair   Sex   perhaps   will   allow ,   but   where   virtue   receives no   injury   true   dignity   can   never   be   hurt .   I   do   not   indeed think   Henry   deserves   so   amiable   a   creature ,   he   seems   to   be a   lively   superficial   Irishman ,   but   the   fair   ones   sentiments are   charming .   Many   thanks   for   ye   Venison   & c   & c .   I   hope   to meet   what   I   think   more   essential   stile   to   making   a   good   dinner at   Mrs   Veseys   table   to   morrow .   I   hope   your   Lordship   was   not   the   worse for   the   airing   Monsey   is   very   jealous   &   vows   he   will   carry   Mrs   Vesey   into   a Forrest 
BC_1762_EMONTAGU_EC	"Sandleford   ye     of   Oct: My   Dear   friend I   ought   to   have   sent   the   inclosed   by   last post ;   but   not   having   time   to   write ,   I   thought ,   as   it   did not   require   an   answer ,   you   would   pardon   my   delaying it   till   I   could   accompany   it   with   a   letter .   My   Lord Bath   left   us   on   thursday   morning .   He   had   the   goodness to   bestow   ten   days   of   his   company   upon   us .   I   never   saw him   in   such   health   &   spirits .   Surely   there   is   no   season   of life   so   happy   as   old   age   where   as   in   him   the   mind seems   matured   &   meliorated   by   time   &   not   impaired in   any   of   its   powers   A   degree   of   perfection   is   then   attain'd   which   even   the   middle season   of   life   can   not   boast .   While   his   Lordship   was   here , he   had   an   a   letter   from   Lord   Pulteney ,   to   inform   him , of   our   troops   having   taken   Valenza .   From   others   he   heard it   was   taken   by   ye   Grenadiers   under   Lord   Pulteneys   command ,   &   by his   conduct   &   valours ;   &   the   King   at   Windsor   repeated the   praises   of   the   young   Hero   to   several   persons .   You   may suppose   my   Lord   Bath   was   very   happy   in   all   this , but   neither   joy   nor   sorrow   makes   him   a   moment   forget his   dignity ;   his   sensibility   is   always   check'd   by   decency but   I   could   see   all   the   tenderness   of   a   Father   under   the restrains   of   prudence .   I   was   delighted   at   an   event   that gave   so   much   joy   &   happiness   to   a   heart   that   seems to   feel   so   generously   for   others .   Things   are   in   this   respect as   they   ought   to   be ;   the   happiness   of   the   benevolent is   shared   by   every   one ;   the   prosperity   of   the   selfish   man is   always   confined   to   himself   alone .   You   shall   certainly have   Mr   Wartons   remarks   on   Spencer   when   you   come   to London ,   the   book   is   Lord   Lytteltons ,   but   I   am   sure   he   will be   glad   to   lend   it   to   you .   I   imagine ,   that   by   Mr   Warton   & Mr   Hurde ,   the   gothick   muses   will   be   more   honoured   than of   late ,   but   your   friends   the   Greeks   will   defend   the   straits of   Parnassus ,   as   they   did   the   straits   of   Thermopylæ   against the   combined   World .   Mr   Hurde   supposes   that   Homer   would have   preferr'd   the   manners   of   the   Western   World ,   in   the days   of   Chivalry ,   to   those   of   the   age   he   wrote   of ,   but   I must   own   I   cannot   agree   with   him ,   Those   who   write   from Nature   write   for   posterity .   Those   who   describe   men   as   form'd by   customs ,   &   inspired   by   some   fanaticism ,   when   those customs   &   opinions   are   worn   out ,   seem   to   have   follow'd   the suggestions   of   their   fancy ,   &   the   reveries   of   a   wild imagination .   Habits   alter ,   but   the   human   shape   remains the   same ,   &   happy   is   the   Poet   who   describes   the   unsophisticated Man .   I   no   more   believe   Homer   would   have   preferd a   Knight   Errant   to   Agamemnon   &   Achilles ,   than   that a   Lysippus   or   Praxiteles ,   would   have   prefer'd   the   figure of   the   Knight   in   armour   with   his   Vizor   up ,   to   a naked   Hercules ,   to   shew   their   art ,   &   perpatuate   their   fame . I   will   own   that   the   Achievements   of   a   Preux   Chevalier are   a   good   subject   for   epick   poetry   on   many   accounts ,   as the   Knight   acts   independantly   his   adventures ,   of   which   the honour   is   not   shared   by   any   one .   He   follows   the   suggestions of   his   personal   courage ,   owes   his   success   to   his   personal qualities ;   is   magnanimous ,   liberal ,   &   courteous ,   fine poetical   virtues .   The   celtick   superstitions ,   the   druidical ceremonies ,   are   all   preferable   to   Homers   Mythology &   have   a   secret   &   sublime   mysterious   air ,   give   a solemn   gravity ,   &   shed   a   twilight   gloom   so   favourable to   fiction ,   while   Homers   Gods   &   Goddesses   too   often   give a   farcical   turn   to   serious   enterprizes .   Milton   whose   learning &   judgment   were   deep ,   often   recurs   to   our   celtick   superstitions &   I   believe   had   he   lived   in   an   age   less   Pedantick ,   he   had made   more   use   of   our   fairies   &   less   of   the   Heathen deities .   He   makes   even   Comus   and   his   crew   a   sort   of   Goblins who   come   forth ,   when   rigor   &   advice   are   gone   to   bed . Comus   say :   We   that   are   of   purer   fire Imitate   the   starry   quire , Who   in   their   nightly   watchfull   spheres Lead   in   swift   round   the   months   &   years . The   sounds   &   Seas ,   with   all   their   finny   drove Now   to   ye   moon   in   wavering   morrice   move . And   on   the   tawny   sands   &   shelves , Trip   the   pert   fairies   &   the   dapper   elves ; By   dimpled   brook ,   &   fountains   brim , The   wood   nymphs   deckt   with   daisies   trim , Their   merry   wakes   &   pastimes   keep . As   Comus   is   the   Son   of   Circe   he   is   obliged   to   keep   partly to   ancient   mythology ,   but   still   I   think   the   verses I   have   quoted   have   a   celtick   air .   The   Lady   talks of   calling   shapes   &   beck'ning   shadows   dire , and   airy   tongues   that   syllable   mens   names on   sands   &   shores   &   desart   wildernesses . The   ender   Brother   speakes   of   "" blue   meager   Hags   &   stubborn   unlaid   ghost That   breaks   his   magick   chain   at   Curfew   time of   Goblin   &   swart   fairy   of   the   mine . To   the   British   Sabrina   he   properly   gives   the   office of   a   beneficent   fairy ,   who   oft   at   Eve   & c .   In   the monody   instead   of   addressing   the   muses   he   calls   to   ye Nymphs   &   says   for   neither   were   you   playing   on   ye   steep Where   your   old   Bards ,   the   famous   Druids ,   lye , Nor   on   the   shaggy   top   of   Mona   high , Nor   yet   where   Deva   spreads   her   wisard   stream , Then   he   talks   of   Orpheus   for   he   still   recurs   to   his classical   learning .   So   in   the   Arcades .   The   genious   of   the Wood   is   of   the   fairy   race .   &   it   is   his   business   from   the   boughs   to brush   the   evil   dew and   heal   the   harms   of   thwarting   thunder   blue   & c . In   short   all   I   mean   is ,   that   Milton   in   spite   of   learned   prejudice perceived   the   fitness   of   the   celtick   faith   to   the   uses   of   poetry . Shakespear   mentions   it   I   think   as   the   right   of   poetry , to   give   to   airy   nothing   a   local   habitation   &   a   name . Those   who   ascribed   a   peculiar   intelligence   to   all   the   elements , &   fill'd   all   nature   with   invisible   beings   had   a   poetical creed .   When   Mr   Hurde   alledges   Miltons   preference   to   the stories   of   Chivalry   from   his   desiring   to   call   up   him who   left   half   told ,   the   story   of   Cambuscan   bold ,   I   think he   argues   partialy .   It   is   one   great   perfection   of   the   Penseroso that   all   the   images   are   shewn   by   twilight ;   there   is   not a   perfectly   apparent   object   in   the   whole   poem .   The   story alluded   to   appears   very   fine   in   the   uncertain   outline   in which   he   draws   it .   In   the   first   place   it   is   of   Cambuscan bold   ,   courage   &   high   enterprize   are   intimated ,   you   know   not   what   was   atchieved   ,   there   is a   virtuous   ring   &   glass ,   you   know   not   of   what   effect , a   wondrous   horse   of   brass ,   on   which   a   Tartar   King   did   ride , very   mysterious   all   he   has   said ,   but   he   adds   if   ought   else great   Bards   beside In   sage   &   solemn   tunes   have   sung , Of   Turneys   &   of   trophies   hung ; Of   Forrests ,   &   enchantments   drear , Where   more   is   meant   than   meets   ye   ear . The   story   appears   the   more   solemn   because   a   man   is   to   be calld   from   the   dead   to   tell   it .   The   judgment   &   taste   of   Milton is   wisely   shewn   in   the   choice   of   a   story ,   which   without being   unfolded   raises   great   &   undefined   ideas ,   &   is   more sublime   in   its   chaos   than   in   its   perfection ,   as   far   as   it goes   in   Chaucer ,   where   I   have   read   it ,   but   how   does   this   shew Miltons   preference   to   Chivalry ?   had   he   not   just   before   invoked tragedy   presenting   Thebes   or   Pelops   line , or   the   tale   of   Troy   divine ? I   think   one   great   recommendation   of   this   story   was   it   was half   told ,   told   by   a   poet   whose   works   are   famous   but not   so   vulgar   &   common   as   the   Classic   poets ,   the   circumstances mysterious ,   &   the   names   sonorous .   Pray   read   over the   peices   of   Milton   I   have   alluded   to ,   &   tell   me   whether I   am   right   in   my   criticisms .   I   am   sure   it   is   a   great advantage   to   a   Poet   to   have   the   belief   &   prejudices   of the   nursery   to   assist   his   fictions ;   they   have   a   sacred horror   which   is   one   of   the   great   sources   of   the   sublime . We   all   see   Hamlets   Fathers   ghost   come   to   reveal   a   murther with   much   more   credence   than   we   should   give   to   the appearance   of   the   deify'd   Hercules   when   he   comes   to advise   Philoctetes   to   go   to   the   destruction   of   Troy   tho   I   think it   a   fine   denoument   of   a   greek   Play ,   but   in   a   brittish Drama   it   wd   shock   me   to   see   Hercules   come   to   the stage   preceded   by   thunder .   For   the   Witches   in   Macbeth I   have   great   complacency ,   Medea   in   her   chariot   drawn by   dragons   hovering   over   a   modern   stage   is   abominable   Merlin   is to   me   a   real   person .   Witches   &   wizards   are   more   familiar to   my   mind   than   Gods   &   Goddeses .   Shakespears   hell   broth is   english   cookery ,   no   soup   in   Medeas   kettle   would   please my   taste   as   well .   The   things   we   but   half   believe ,   &   but half   understand ,   are   fine   ingredients   in   poetry .   I   would have   the   characters   in   a   poem   drawn   from   nature ,   the religion   from   tradition .   I   am   however   pleased   with   our   Criticks for   bringing   us   back   to   Brittish   stories .   The   Greek   tragedians did   not   lay   their   scenes   in   Egypt .   Voltaire   has   a   tragedy built   on   chivalry ,   &   it   has   its   merit ;   but   the   character of   his   Knight   is   like   the   portrait   of   a   french   beauty , whose   features   were   so   disguised   by   farde   &   rouge   the painter   seems   not   to   have   justly   copied   nature ,   tho perhaps   he   exactly   delineated   the   original .   If   I   have   tired you   with   idle   criticisms   you   will   be   recreated   by   considering the   passages   of   Milton   &   Shakespear   alluded   to ,   &   I   think it   will   give   you   some   pleasure   to   observe   how   they   have mix d   our   legends   with   the   ancient   mythology ,   which dignifies   the   tales   of   the   naries   &   authenticates   the stories   of   the   poets .   I   have   enclosed   some   greek   which   I   desire you   to   explain .   The   great   Monsey   says   Plutarch   uses this   expression ,   all   about   Pompey   to   signify   Pompey himself .   I   hope   your   blister   will   not   plague   &   teize your   head   as   this   expression   has   done   mine .   The   greek you   will   see   is   in   my   Lord   Baths   hand .   I   am   much grieved   at   your   state   of   health .   I   hope   the   blister   will be   of   service ,   &   remember   Huxhams   tincture   .   I   have orderd   my   maid   in   Town   to   send   you   a   famous   plaister for   your   blister .   I   have   been   much   better   for   these   last three   weeks .   I   congratulate   you   on   our   success   at   the Havannah ,   I   hope   it   will   facilitate   a   peace . I   have   just   been   reading   again   Boileaus   translation   of Longinus   on   the   sublime ,   I   borrow d   it   of   my   Lord   Bath , &   we   both   agreed   to   wish   you   would   give   us   an   english translation   of   Longinus ;   he   is   a   fine   writer   surely   &   your pen   wd   do   him   justice ,   &   indeed   my   dear   friend   you   know   that   next   to true   religion   &   pure   morals   I   place   just   criticism . You   may   in   notes   give   us   Aristotles   opinions ,   &   those of   other   criticks ,   &   do   your   Countrymen   great   service , Who   are   wandering   after   strange   whims   &   fancies . I   desire   my   best   respects   to   Dr   Carter   &   all   your   family ,   & particularly   to   Mrs   Underdown ,   whom   I   depend   upon   to pack   you   off   to   London   on   ye   first   of   jany   .   Pray be   particular   in   the   account   of   your   health . I   am   my   Dearest   friend most   affectionately   yours E:Montagu "
BC_1762_EMONTAGU_EV_1	Hillstreet   ye     Dear   Madam My   lively   agreable   mermaids   letter being   out   of   its   element   by   land   carriage ,   did   not   get to   me   till   Saturday   night .   I   dined   out ,   &   was   not   at home   till   was   late   for   the   post .   alas   my   Dear   Madam Minerva ,   Athens ,   &   their   subject   &   Servant   Mr   Stewart , have   had   no   share   in   my   detention   in   London .   yet here   I   have   been   ever   since   I   left   those   Elysian   fields where   we   were   all   so   happy   in   Worcestershire .   I   was grievously   tormented   with   pains   in   my   teeth   in   my journey   to   Town ,   so   I   sent   to   Mr   Galin   who   has   been very   busy   upon   my   unfortunate   jaws   ever   since . It   was   no   small   consolation   to   me   that   my   Lord Bath   spent   some   days   in   Town   in   his   way   to Tunbridge ,   but   I   am   now   reduced   to   the   lowest condition   of   human   life ,   not   a   friend ,   not   one   of mes   amans   sexagenaires   ,   nor   even   my   Mounteban remains .   Represent   to   your   self   a   miserable Ariadne   in   an   old   tapestry   hanging   faded   &   dusty triste   &   pale ,   &   you   will   see   a   true   resemblance   of   the person   &   condition   of   your   humble   servant .   you know   nothing   of   what   has   happen'd   to   the   party since   you   left   it   at   Warwick   so   I   will   send   you memoires   pour   servir   à   l'histoire   des   illustres   Voyages We   went   to   Warwick   Castle   with   which   you   are so   well   acquainted   I   shall   not   say   any   thing   of it .   after   that   to   the   dairy ,   where   there   is   not   a Dun   cow   for   the   present   Earl   of   Warwick   to   try his   prowess   upon ,   but   many   good   milck   cows   & other   things   suitable   to   a   dairy .   but   with   the greatest   veneration   I   behold   the   walk   of   Sir Philip   Sydney ,   where   he   mix'd ,   as   in   his   Arcadia noble   sentiments   with   rural   ideas .   We   went   afterwards to   the   Church   where   the   great   Earl   surnamed   the King   maker   lies   as   quiet   &   in   as   little   compass as   any   maker   of   cabbage   nets   can   do .   In   that mornings   journey   we   got   to   Kenilworth   Castle , which   shows   still   some   of   the   strength   with   which Simon   de   Montfort   made   head   against   his sovereign ,   &   some   of   the   magnificence   with   which Robert   Dudley   entertain'd   his .   The   Lady   of   the   Lake is   turn'd   into   an   honest   dairy   maid ,   the Lake   is     into   fine   pasture ,   &   all   the   domains of   the   Castle   show   peace   &   plenty   possess   the   Land . The   old   Ivy   like   a   faithfull   servant   adheres   to   the place ,   &   seems   proud   of   its   connection   with   this strong   &   noble   castle .   I   never   saw   more   beautifull ruins   than   there   at   Kenilworth ,   &   the   Ivy   like the   grey   hairs   of   old   age   covers   what   would appear   deform'd   &   bald ,   &   at   the   same   render   its aspect   more   venerable .   I   will   own   I   could   have wish'd   for   the   sake   of   the   picture ,   the   fox   had   peep d through   the   broken   windows ,   &   the   Owl   had   shown her   melancholly   face   among   the   battlements ,   but Cows   were   grazing ,   &   fat   geese   feeding   among the   ruins   of   the   Castle ,   there   wanted   the   dark shade   of   horror   &   melancholly   to   give   ye   true Sublime .   Vide   Burke .   page   ye   - .   Our   next   excursion was   to   Boughton ,   which   is   a   great   french   palace very   noble ,   very   magnificent ,   but   a   little   dull . It   is   not   the   place   in   which   you   would   chuse to   be   pensive ,   nor   in   which   you   would   be indeed   to   be   chearfull ,   it   is   the   great   seat   of   a great   nobleman ,   not   pleasing   &   elegant   like   the Countess   of   Cardigan ,   nor   polishd   &   adorn'd   by the   fine   arts   like   her   son   Lord   Montagu .   The   plantations are   extreamly   fine .   A   woman   as   deaf   as a   post ,   shew d   us   the   house ,   questions   one   could   not make   her   hear ,   but   being   of   a   temper   very   communicative , &   not   very   precise   in   her   knowledge , She   shew d   us   the   picture   of   K   Charles   ye   second for   that   of   Edwd   the   first ,   with   many   other   things in   which   the   chronology   was   as   happily   determined . There   is   a   Carbon   of   Raphaels   in   the   Hall   which charm'd   me   more   than   any   thing   I   ever   saw . The   rest   of   our   journey   was   merely   passing   through the   turnpike   road ,   the   number   of   Monseys   stories infinitely   exceeded   those   of   the   mile   stones .   I   made now   &   then   an   escape   from   his   stories   to   the   allegory of   Spencer   &   so   arrived   at   home   much   pleased   with all   that   I   had   hear'd   &   seen   since   my   setting   out but most   with   the   time   we   pass'd   at   Hagley where   every   thing   bears   the   character   of   its   Master . 
BC_1762_EMONTAGU_EV_2	Reading   Sunday   ye   of aug   When   I   received   my   Dear   Mrs   Veseys letter   on   Friday   I   was   so   ill   with   the   old   complaint in   my   stomach   I   durst   not   write   even   a   line .   On Saturday   morning   I   went   to   Mrs   Stanleys   at   Clewar where   I   staid   till   to   day ,   after   church   I   set   out for   Sandleford ,   &   am   got   as   far   as   Reading .   My   Sister is   to   come   to   me   on   Wenesday ,   &   I   had   intended to   set   out   for   Southampton   to   morrow ,   &   stay   with you   till   Wenesday ,   but   I   continue   so   much indisposed   I   should   be   a   heavy   weight   on   your hands .   Mr   Montagu   intends   to   come   to   Sandleford this   week   so   I   fear   all   my   agreable   prospect   of Southampton   must   vanish .   My   head   akes   &   I   must indulge   it   by   lolling   is   a   great   chair   till   the Coach   is   ready   to   carry   me   home .   Pray   go   to   the Isle   of   Wight   if   it   can   be   done   safely   but   do   not run   any   hazards .   I   shall   write   to   you   again   my Dear   Madam   as   soon   as   I   can .   I   hope   the   fresh air   will   make   me   as   well   as   I   was   at   Hagley but   I   have   been   much   out   of   order   for   some time . I   am   Dear   Madam Ever   yrs E M My   best   respects   attend   My   Lady Primrose   &   Mrs   Hancock .   It   is   now said   the   poor   Czar   is   mad . Lord   Metcombe   has   left   a personal   estate   of   about   L to   an   old   Mr   Wyadham .   he   has   left L   to   Sr   W:   Britten   &   a   gold snuff   box   to   Ld   Bute 
BC_1762_EMONTAGU_EV_3	Sandleford   ye     of   Sept Dear   Madam I   am   as   angry   as   you   can   be ,   at   the   peevish destinies ,   who   decreed   we   should   not   meet   at   Southampton .   Have   not these   fatal   virgins   the   thread   of   all   Heroes   lives   in   Exxxx   on   their distaffe ,   &   the   shears   of   war   in   their   hands ?   &   with   such   great   mischief in   their   power ,   who   meddle   with   our   parties   &   amusements ?   Our going   to   Southampton   was   not   resolved   till   the   night   before   we set   out   the   precariousness   of   my   health ,   &   a   doubt   whether   it   would be   agreable   to   Mr   Montagu ,   made   me   afraid   to   propose   it   till I   found   he   was   at   leisure   to   go ,   &   I   was   well   enough   to   venture . With   much   alacrity   I   set   out   on   an   expedition   which   promised me   a   Sight   of   Mrs   Vesey   &   her   friends .   I   shall   give   the   order   of   our progress   as   you   desire .   We   went   from   hence   to   Winchester ,   to   shew my   Sister   this   Cathedral ;   the   body   of   it   was   built   by   William of   Wickham ,   the   munificent   minister   of   a   prodigal   Prince   by such   persons ,   &   in   such   times ,   the   noblest   publick   works   are   perfected especially   where ,   as   in   this   case ,   the   Donors   good   taste   directs   has   liberality The   Church   of   Winchester   is   one   of   most   beautifull   Gothic   buildings I   ever   saw ,   there   is   Majesty   &   simplicity   united .   Art   borrow'd   the pattern   from   nature ,   for   it   is   just   a   long   arch   of   fir   trees   roof'd , all   the   beams   &   rafters   represent   the   crossing   and   interlacing of   the   boughs .   There   are   the   bones   of   several   saxon   Kings   deposited here   in   a   sort   of   trunk's .   You   know   a   small   space   will   contain the   dead   bodies   of   men   of   much   more   intended   dominion   than   our Saxon   Princes .   Much   painted ,   gilded ,   decorated ,   lies   Cardinal Beauforts   figure   on   his   tomb ;   his   present   appearance   &   former character ,   makes   one   consider   him   rather   as   High   Priest   to   the Scarlet   Dame   of   Babylon ,   than   as   a   descendant   of   the   Apostles . We   should   next   have   visited ,   if   our   time   had   not   been   as limited ,   the   famous   round   table   which   tradition   calls   King Arthurs .   I   believe   fable   made   this   mighty   champion   &   this   gave   him a   round   table   &   Knights   to   desire   at   it ,   but   in   commemoration of   his   feasts ,   the   Knights   of   later   days   did   realy   give   great publick   entertainments   at   this   table   after   their   jests   &   Tournaments ,   which more   often   held   near   Winchester ,   The   said   table   is   therefore very   venerable   in   the   eyes   of   all   true   lovers   of   ancient   Chivalry , &   I   wish'd   to   pay   my   respects   to   it .   But   when   we   had   dined ,   we found   we   must   make   the   best   of   our   way   to   the   Militia   camp . We   drank   tea   at   Mr   Norborne   Berkelys   tent .   The   days   of   Chivalry never   produced   more   courteous   or   more     Cavalier ,   &   I   wish d I   had   brought   him   Arthurs   round   table ,   which   his   liberality would   replenish ,   &   his   hospitality   adorn .   The   camp   is   prettily disposed   on   a   fine   rising   ground .   But   what   much   delighted   the peaceable   beholder   was ,   to   see   the   sheep   feeding   ,   &   the   tender   lambkins frisking ,   amongst   the   tents   of   these   doughtily   Militia   men . No   neighing   steeds   impatient   for   battle ,   no   smiths   mending   armour gave   note   of   dreadfull   preparation ,   when   the   band   of   musick &   the   drums   ceased ,   the   sheep   bleated ,   once   indeed   the   Drum beat   in   a   very   spirited   manner ,   &   almost   alarm'd   my   cowardly Spirit ,   but   upon   being   assured   it   was   only   for   dinner ,   I   was convinced   I   might   stay   in   the   camp   very   safely ,   where   I   believe no   mischief will   happen ,   unless   some   Militia   Hero ,   should   like Ajax   run   mad ,   &   slay   sheep   in   his   ire .   It   grew   dark   before   we rea chd   Southampton ,   by   which   means   we   lost   a   very   fine   prospect , but   any   prospect   was   Mrs   Vesey ,   I   ask'd   my   Landlord   when   I [ got   to   the   Inn   if   you   was   still   at   Southampton ?   he   said   he believed   so ,   I   had   intended   following   you   to   the   publick   room if   you   had   been   there ;   to   have   accosted   you   with   great   , &   have   enjoy'd   your   .   My   sister   who   had   a   violent   head ach   conceal'd   it   as   much   as   she   could ,   that   I   might   go   in   my frolick   with   good   spirits .   I   was   much   grieved   when   I   sent   to   your lodgings   to   find   you   had   left   Southampton   that   very   day . My   poor   sister   soon   went   to   bed   excessively   ill ,   so   the   evening concluded   in   a   melancholly   manner .   She   was   pretty   well   the next   day ,   &   we   went   to   the   Castle   of   Southampton ,   of   the   beauty of   the   prospect   there ,   I   shall   not   say   any   thing ,   as   you   are undoubtedly   better   acquainted   with   it   than   I   am .   From   Southampton we   came   home   through   a   country ,   which   the   Squires   who are   of   the   race   of   Nimrod   &   love   hunting   much   extoll ,   but to   me   it   appear'd   bleak   &   desolate .   The   D:   of   Marbrough   is   descended from   a   Hero   who   made   rapid   conquests ,   so   I   do   not   wonder   at   his manner   of   proceeding ;   but   I   imagine ,   he   hunted   as   much   to   the fair   ones   being   well   disposed   to   him ,   as   to   his   invincible   name , in   spite   of   which   he   would   know ,   That   wilful   love   he   must   with   smiles   appease approach   his   awfull   throne   by   just   degrees , and   if   he   wou'd   be   happy ,   learn   to   please When   Cupid   invites   Hymen ,   tho   reckon'd   the   least   complaisant   of all   the   Divinities ,   he   will   come   at   moments   warning .   when   Hymen invites   Cupid ,   it   is   a   thousand   to   one   the   ungracious   boy   never comes   at   all .   I   see   the   whole   affair   of   this   wedding   has   been   conducted by   the   God   of   love ,   Hymen   &   he   pronounced   the   nuptial   benediction &   all   the   World   will   say   amen   to   it .   I   could   chide   you   my   Dear friend   for   not   having   your   letters   sent   to   you   to   Southampton . you   would   then   have   met   Lord   Lyttelton   at   Sandleford Mr   Lyttelton &   he   staid   a   week   here ,   &   left   us   on   friday .   I   was   disappointed of   my   Lord   Baths   company ,   so   poor   Lord   Lyttelton   had   but a   dull   party :   to   amuse   him ,   we   carried   him   to   see   all   the places   in   this   neigborhood   that   can   boast   of   any   remarkable beauty ,   but   we   have   not   any   place   that   can   at   all   compare to   Hagley .   The   news   of   Admiral   Smythes   death   arrived   on wenesday   night ,   it   gave   great   grief   to   Lord   Lyttelton ,   and will   cast   a   damp   on   the   pleasures   of   Hagley .   Mr   Montagu   &   I took   great   pains   to   perswade   his   Lordship   to   stay   a   week   or fortnight   longer   with   us ,   not   to   fall   in   with   the   funeral   ceremony &   see   the   place   so   immediately   after   the   death   of   his   friend   & Brother ,   but   we   could   not   prevail ,   he   had   appointed   company &   would   not   put   them   off   I   am   glad   you   received   the   vision safe ,   &   beg   of   you   not   to   let   it   go   out   of   your   hands ,   for   I   would not   have   it   get   into   the   news   papers .   I   fancy   I   should   make such   a   figure   in   print   as   an   insect   does   in   spirits   of   wine in   the   Brittish   Museum ;   on   my   native   cabbage   but   I   am   a   good kind   of   harmless   animal ,   but   I   don't   like   to   be   examined by   the   virtuosi ,   nor   to   have   my   insignificancy   preserved   in immortal   verse .   If   Lord   Lytteltons   Metamorphosis   of   me   would pass ,   I   should   like   it   very   much ,   but   my   poetical   decorations will   be   taken   off   &   I   shall   be   consider'd   in   my   original   and natural   form ,   to   which   obscurity   is   the   best   friend .   You   are very   good   in   your   concern   for   my   health .   I   was   pretty   well before   I   went   to   Southampton ,   &   thought   the   journey   &   change of   air   of   service   to   a   bad   cough   that   hung   upon   me   but the   night   I   came   home   I   was   very   ill   again ,   &   am   now growing   better .   I   am   sorry   you   want   the   help   of     Galin : he   cured   me   of   the   toothach ,   &   fasten'd   two   teeth   which   began to   loosen ,   but   the   pain   of   the   operations ,   &   the   disagreableness of   the   oils   &   other   things   with   which   he   washes   the   mouth is   such ,   I   cannot   advise   you   without   great   necessity   to apply   to   him .   I   am   less   afraid   of   pain   than   most   people , not   only   from   having   read   my   friends   translation   of   a stoick   philosopher   with   great   attention ,   but   indeed   by   being accustom'd   to   pain ,   but   yet   I   cannot   say   Mr   Galins   operations are   no   evil .   I   beg   when   you   write   that   you   inform   me   how   the Duchess   of   Portland   does .   I   am   afraid   her   health   &   spirits   are not   so   good   as   I   wish   them   .   Lady   Hervey   does   me   great   honor in   enquiring   after   me .   I   wish   you   would   be   so   good   as   to   present my   compliments .   I   shall   have   a   greater   pleasure   in   one   good news   from   the   Havannah   for   the   particular   interest   Lady Hervey   takes   in   it ,   as   her   Ladyships   adds   much   to   the   pleasure of   polite   life   in   London ,   I   fancy   she   improves   rural   life   in the   Country ,   &   that   the   graces   play   about   her   there   as   the   sheep flock   about   the   Militia   men   who   before   they   were   encamped were   Shepherds   &   used   to   lead   them .   I   shall   be   much   obliged to   you   for   sending   me   any   news ,   for   I   hear   nothing   but   the whispering   of   the   wind   here .   On   the     I   expect   my   Lord   Bath &   Doctor   Monsey ,   &   between   gracefull   wisdom   &   agreable   folly I   expect   to   be   well   amused ,   in   the   mean   time   I   divert   my   self with   my   books ,   &   my   eyes   are   so   complaisant   as   to   let   me   entertain myself   as   much   as   I   please ,   &   I   often   remember   yours &   Mrs   Carters   care ,   &   Mr   Gatiliers   skill   with   gratitude . You   see   that   at   your   commands   my   pen   has   changed   the   habit of   being   tired ,   to   that   of   tiring .   I   wish   you   may   have   ye   obstinacy not   to   repent   of   so   rash   an   order ,   but   I   am   always   with the   most   ready   obedience Dear   Madam Your   Faithfull   Humble   Sert E:   Montagu I   beg   my   best   respects   to   Lady   Primrose &   Mrs   Hancock .   I   am   very   sorry   to   hear Lady   Primrose   is   not   in   perfect   health . I   am   very   much   in   earnest   as   to   what   I said   about   ye   vision .   You   know   I   would   not let   Mrs   Carter   print   my   name . 
BC_1763_EMONTAGU_EV_1	Dear   Madam I   was   extreamly   concern'd   to   find   you   had calld   at   my   door   yesterday   afternoon   before   I   had given   orders   to   have   some   of   my   particular   friends let   in ,   but   my   Spirits   had   been   so   agitated   by   an   interview with   my   Lord   Bath   just   before   dinner ,   I   was   obliged to   repose   myself   for   some   time .   I   found   him   composed   and resign'd ,   &   the   deeply   afflicted   he   has   a   christian   heroism , a   pious   fortitude   to   which   all   the   boasted   pride   of   stoicism appears   mean .   While   he   weeps   for   his   son ,   he   bends   with resignation   to   the   chastizing   but   mercifull   hand   of   his eternal   Father .   No   Days   of   his   prosperity   were   so   truly great   &   illustrious   as   these   of   his   affliction ,   as   greatly as   I   have   always   respected   him .   I   never   knew   his   real   worth till   this   tryal .   he   appears   in   the   dignity   of   heavenly Grace ,   which   it   has   pleased   God   to   indue   him   on   this occasion .   I   am   sure   you   will   be   glad   to   hear   that   his mind   is   all   fix'd   on   the   object   that   can   never   fail   in   whom   these     disappointments .   He   looks dreadfully   pale ,   but   his   health   is   as   well   as   it   is possible   to   expect .   I   wish   if   you   go   out   you   could   come to   me   this   evening ,   the   shock   &   surprize   of   this   sad   news has   disorderd   my   nerves   &   spirits   to   such   a   degree   I   am not   sure   I   shall   be   well   enough   to   wait   on   you I   will   soon   thank   you   my   dear   Mrs   Vesey ,   for   the   pleasure I   received   from   your   letter   last   night .   
BC_1763_EMONTAGU_EV_2	Spa   ye     of   july I   did   not   receive   my   dear   Mrs   Veseys letter   till   just   before   I   left   London ,   when   I   was   immersed in   the   business   of   packing   up ,   &   the   ceremony   of taking   leave ;   &   since   I   commenced   my   journey ,   you   will believe ,   the   variety   &   novelty   of   the   objects   may   have given   me   des   distractions   .   I   will   not   trouble   you with   descriptions   of   places   you   are   acquainted   with , but   as   I   flatter   myself   you   take   an   interest   in   the travellers ,   I   will   give   you   an   account   of   the   circumstances of   our   journey .   We   left   London   the   fourth of   june ,   some   hours   before   the   papillotes   were   taken off   the   heads   of   the   beaux   ,   or   the   rouge   laid   on the   cheeks   of   the   belles   who   were   to   appear   at the   birthday   drawing   room ;   if   this   date   is   not   very exact   as   to   the   hour ,   it   is   at   least   very   poetical , &   a   more   elegant   description   of   the   morning   than   that which   begins   with   brick   dust   moll ,   the   idea   of Lady   Mary   with   rouge   being   certainly   more   delicate . On   the   sixth   of   june   we   set   sail   from   Dover ,   as Mrs   Carter   had   written   some   epistles   dedicatory to   Neptune ,   he   smooth'd   his   waves ,   &   amphitrite expanded   her   Sail   to   catch   the   gentle   gales ;   the Nereids   guided   the   vessel ,   &   avion   astride   as Dolphin   play'd   the   finest   water   musick   imaginable till   we   got   into   the   harbour   at   Calais .   On the   shore   we   were   met   by   certain   mermen   crownd with   sea   weeds ,   who   carried   mesdames   Carter   & Montagu   on   their   backs .   as   the   petticoats   were a   little   discomposed   in   this   new   way   of   walking on   other   mens   legs ,   it   is   better   not   to   be   too   minute in   the   description   of   it ,   all   I   shall   say   is   that Phoebus   who   has   a   penetrating   eye ,   told   his   nine prudes   of   Mrs   Carters   want   of   decorum ,   &   advised them   not   to   be   so   intimate   with   her   for   the   future , They   redden'd ,   pull'd   up   their   heads ,   &   mutterd something   about   Daphne ,   which   you   may   imagine the   God   of   Witt   &   parent   of   repartee   answer'd   very smartly ,   &   no   one   knows   how   far   might   have proceeded   the   dispute ,   if   the   Poet   Laureate   had not   just   then   offer'd   his   petition   for   their assistance   to   deliver   him   of   a   simile   simile   on which   the   very   existence   of   his   ode   was   to   depend . At   Calais   we   staid   one   entire   day .   My   Lord   Bath had   a   visit   from   the   Prince   de   Groye   the   Governor . &   the   officers   of   the   Garrison   came   to   invite   us   to see   them   act   a   play ,   but   as   it   was   sunday evening ,   in   true   protestant   spirit   we   declined it .   From   Calais   we   went   to   St   Omers ,   where   we   saw the   jesuits   College ,   we   ask'd   for   greek   manuscripts for   the   amusement   of   Mrs   Carter ,   to   the   great amazement   of   the   Librarian ,   who   imagined her   to   be   possess'd ,   &   would   fain   have   exercised   her , but   we   assured   him   her   learning   could   not lye   more   quietly   in   the   red   sea   than   it   did in   her   hand ,   such   was   the   depth   of   her   capacity . We   were   charm'd   with   the   Town   of   Lisle   which was   our   next   stage ,   &   here   behold   the   metamorphosis of   Mrs   Carter .   She   now   began   to   consider Greek   was   a   dead   language ,   &   that   french   words , &   a   little   coquettry ,   would   do   better   at   Spa ;   so   with the   same   facility   with   which   she   translated Epictetus   from   greek   into   english ,   she   translated her   native   timidity   into   french   airs ,   &   french modes ;   bought   robes   trimmed   with   blonde   ( ,   Colliers ,   bouquets ,   des   engageantes   )   &   all   the most   labour'd   ornaments   of   dress ;   &   as   soon   as she   was   equip'd ,   wishd   for   a   walk   in   the   Suillerie , more   than   she   had   ever   done   for   one   in   the Parties .   Instead   of   translating   the   memorable   things of   Socrates   you   may   expect   a   lively   &   spirited translation   of   les   amours   &   amourettes   du Marque   de   -   ,   &   instead   of   Plato's   phædon she   will   translate   les   egaremens   du   coeur &   d'espirit   of   Crebillon   .   From   Lisle   went   to   Brussels , where   we   staid   tree   days ,   which   Mrs   Carter   spent chiefly   in   purchasing   more   apparel .   We   visited the   Nunnerys   in   every   Town ;   Mrs   Carter   constantly expressing   the   greatest   abhorrence   of   their   strict Vows ,   &   sequester'd   life ,   with   an   air   of   libertinism extreamly   suited   to   the   gayety   of   her   dress   and coquettry   of   her   manners .   However ,   as   I   would   not   do my   friend   the   least   injustice ,   I   must   assure   you   ,   she has   not   yet   put   on   rouge ,   nor   indeed   am   I convinced   that   she   intends   it .   I   do   not   know   whether my   friends   french   manners   have   given   me a   prejudice .   in   favour   of   that   agreably   frivolous nation   but   every   thing   seem'd   to   me   to   wear   a less   pleasing   aspect   from   the   moment   we   left the   french   dominions .   Brussels   has   the   air   of a   Town   of   shopkeepers ,   the   people   look   heavy   & stupid ,   the   houses   are   dark   &   melancholly ,   and Inland   trade   has   not   so   amusing   an   appearance as   our   Towns   of   foreign   Commerce .   The   Town   house indeed   is   very   fine ,   &   the   tapestry   exceeded   my expectations .   I   was   every   where   surprized   at   the gay   decorations   of   the   Churches ,   &   wonder'd   to find   the   priests   did   not   esteem   melancholly the   best   friend   of   superstition ,   The   altars   seem'd rather   adapted   to   the   worship   of   the   Goddess   Flora than   to   the   supreme   Being .   The   Nuns   as   little answerd   my   expectation The   pensive   nun   devout   &   pure Sober   stedfast   &   demure . I   did   not   find   in   any   of   the   Convents ,   on   the   contrary an   affectation   of   gayety   which   gave   the   air of   boarding   school   girls   to   these   sanctified   vessels , whatever   they   said   to   convince   me   they   were happy   had   the   contrary   effect ,   they   assured   me their   time   never   lay   on   their   hands ,   but   the detail   of   its   imployment   was   such   as   must convince   one   a   rational   mind   must   feel   vexation if   it   had   not   leisure   for   ennui   in   the   discharge of   such   devoirs .   Sequestration   from   the   World   without enthusiasm   must   be   a   strange   state .   The   regular &   quick   succession   of   their   divine   worship   must damp   all   piety ,   &   I   realy   believe   these   poor   nuns have   less   devotion   than   secular   persons .   From   frequent disappointments   &   afflictions   we   are   Taught   to wish   for   a   better   World   if   thick   walls   seperated us   from   this   we   should   not   know   how   little happiness   it   affords .   You   will   begin   to   think   I am   long   on   my   journey   to   Spa ,   however   I   will   not detain   you   much   at   Leige ,   the   entrance   to   it   gives a   charming   romantick   view ,   but in   the   Town   you see   the   most   sordid   poverty ,   figures   hardly   human with   all   the   vices ,   without   the   virtues   &   accomplishments of   civil   society ,   all   sorts   of   crimes   are committed   with   impunity ,   unless   private   revenge points   the   stilletto   when   the   sword   of   the   Magistrate ought   to   have   been   directed .   Here   the   rash advocates   for   unbounded   liberty   may   see   a people   more   wretched   under   the   reign   of   anarchy than   the   severest   despotism   could   make   them . Our   journey   from   Leige   in   respect   of   roads   was bad   enough   but   the   unusual   wildness   of   the Country   made   amends   for   it .   On   the   summit of   a   bleak   Mountain   we   had   a   violent   hurricane which   gave   all   the   terror   to   the   sublime   which our   friend   Mr   Burke   desires ,   as   I   had   been   reading Ossian   I   imagined   the   spirits   of   Loda   were   riding over   our   heads ,   the   deep   voiced   thunder   was a   fine   accompaniment   to   all   these   horrors .   The storm   soon   subsided ,   &   the   black   clouds   now   & then   casting   a   shade   on   some   of   the   woods while   others   were   gilded   by   the   sun   made most   charming   prospects ,   &   from   the   preceding rains   the   mountains   poured   down   torrents   from   their sides ,   so   that   I   imagine   we   saw   this   Country in   the   state   best   suited   to   its   form   &   features . On   the   fifteenth   of   june   we   arrived   here .   Our   journey was   as   agreable   as   possible .   My   Lord   Bath   was as   polite   &   as   gay   every   morning   in   the   Coach   at six   as   you   have   seen   him   in   an   evenings   assembly . his   health   improved   every   day ,   &   he   is   now   the youngest   &   the   gayest   man   here ,   & the   universal passion   of   all   the   Foreigners ,   from   the   Serenissimo's &   Serenissima's   to   the   Dutch   Bourgmestres   &   their fat   wives .   We   have   now   here   Son   Altesse   the   Bishop of   Augsburg   Son   Altesse   Royale   Prince   Ferdinand of   Prussia   &   his   Princess ,   the   hereditary   Prince   of Brunswick ,   the   Princess   Esterhasie ,   the   Princess of   Salm ,   &   Count   Blankenheim   a   sovereign Prince ,   &   next   week   we   expect   Duke   Ferdinand , the   Princess   Emilie   the   King   of   Prussias   sister ,   but the   Hero   of   Hero's   alas !   does   not   come .   My   letter is   already   of   such   an   unreasonable   length   I will   not   describe   the   great   persons   that   compose Our   Drama .

BC_1763_EMONTAGU_EV_4	To   Mrs   Vesey   ? A   postscript   to   be   read   before   the   letter . Why   do   you   laugh   at   that   Mrs   Vesey ?   are   papers like   Heirs   made   to   take   place   according   to   seniority of   age   &   priority   of   birth ?   I   say   read   my   postscript which   shall   be   what   postscripts   never   was   before   ( on this   side   the   water   at   least )   it   shall   be   a   prologue &   a   preface   which   perhaps   is   the   Hebrew   fashion ,   & for   the   sake   of   that   Hebrician   Mrs   Carter   take   it a   l'hebreu   .   You   will   find   in   my   letter   that   I   am giving   you   some   trouble   to   convey   a   letter   to   a   Lady at   Limerick .   I   imagine   you   may   know   some   person   there , if   not   you   will   find   some   friend   who   has   an   acquaintance there   whom   they   can   prevail   on   to   speak   to   Mrs   Moore If   you   please   you   may   send   my   letter   to   the   person who   is   to   talk   with   Mrs   Moore   &   it   will   show   what   is desired .   I   made   it   short   &   insipid ,   &   so   innocent   you   may give   it   a   child ,   as   ye   quack   Doctors   say   of   their   powder of   post .   I   will   now   tell   you   I   am   much   interested   for this   young   man ,   not   for   his   own   sake ,   for   he   is a   paltry   youth ,   too   flimsey   of   brain   to   make   a   prudent or   an   honest   man ,   but   I   wd   do   my   best   to   prevent his   ruin   for   the   sake   of   his   mother   a   most   amiable Woman   who   full   of   regard   for   her   children   retired   in her   early   widow   hood   to   the   cave   of   Malvina ,   there the   lonely   watcher   of   the   night   sat   listening   winds when   she   might   have   given   an   ear   to   the   softer Sighing   of   lovers .   She   has   been   a   perfect   Penelope   in constant   love   &   solitary   woe .   She   has   a   small   house surrounded   by   rocks   through   which   winds   &   rapid   river over   her   head   impend   black   mountains   &   if   the   sun visits   her   it   is   with   oblique   rays .   In   this   place   she educated   her   daughter   with   all   the   care   &   tenderness imaginable ,   form'd   her   heart   to   virtue ,   her   mind   to knowledge ,   &   her   form   to   grace   &   dignity .   If   a   poet had   met   her   on   the   banks   of   the   river   he   wd   have address'd   to   her   as   the   nymph   of   the   stream   &   calld her   Sabrina ,   Arethusa ,   or   some   river   divinity   but as   we   are   not   poetical   in   Northumberland   she   was call'd   Miss   Grey   Miss   Grey   toute   courte   &   Mr   Grey   Brother to   Sir   Henry   Grey   her   relation   married   her .   tho   a   younger Brother   he   has   a   genteel   fortune   &   so   our   Penelope is   happy   in   her   daughter   but   very   unhappy   in her   son .   He   was   taken   from   her   by   his   Grandfather who   is   a   good   sort   of   man   &   was   very   fond   of   the   youth &   is   now   at     made   very   wretched   by   his   misconduct &   I   do   not   much   like   Mrs   Moore   for   marrying   her daughter   to   a   young   man   without   his   parents   consent if   you   know   any   thing   of   ye   family   either   of   their circumstances   &   moral   character   I   shd   be   glad to   have   information   of   it   that   we   may   know   how to   proceed .   Mrs   Grey   when   she   was   Miss   Ogle   had   ye honour   of   knowing   you .   I   do   not   know   how   she appeard   when   she   was   a   girl   but   her   superior understanding   &   manners   made   an   impression   upon me   the   first   time   I   saw   her ,   &   I   have   liked   her   better &   better   on   further   acquaintance   with   her   &   further information   of   her   character .   I   wish   she   had   educated her   son ,   she   wd   have   given   him   nobler   sentiments . My   old   cousin   told   him   ten   times   a   day   that   a   penny saved   was   a   penny   got   that   money   was   always   a friend ,   &   a   thousand   such   good   saws ,   but   without   fixd principles   of   virtue   what   signify   maxims   of   prudence . The   foundations   of   virtue   well   laid   prudent   conduct   will follow ,   but   Parents   are   apt   to   think   selfishness   will make   a   man   happy ,   whereas   in   fast   headstrong selfishness   betrays   to   every   mischief ,   &   to   such   a   disposition the   tyes   of   duty   are   much   weaker   than   the   impulse to   pleasure .   I   desire   you   to   write   when   you   have   nothing to   do ,   I   am   forced   to   write   when   I   have   nothing   to   say . I   am   frozen   with   cold ,   I   am   petrifyed   with   dullness , I   long   to   come   out   of   my   Coal   hole ,   but   I   fear   it will   be   three   weeks   before   I   get   to   London   tho   I   am perfectly   of   SrEvremonts   opinion   qu'il   n'y   a   point   de   salut pour   les   honnetes   gens   hors   du   Capitale   .   I   desire your   letters   ( not   your   prayers )   for   a   poor   soul   in   the purgatory   of   business .   I   hear   you   are   all   very   lively in   Ireland .   Our   house   of   Commons   will   spare   you Mr   Wilkes   if   you   have   any   occasion   for   him ,   Adieu Dear   Madam ,   if   alas   all   the   pains   I   have   been   at to   regulate   the   precedency   of   postscript   &   letter terrified   at   the   apparent   length   you   shd   not read   either   of   them ?   but   if   you   don't   read   them   yr self   you   will   make   Mrs   Hancock   who   will   do   any thing   for   yr   sake .

BC_1763_EMONTAGU_GL	Hague   ye     My   Lord Your   Lordship   will   think   I   am   become perfectly   dutch   if   I   tell   you   that   the   paragraph   which pleased   me   most   in   your   very   elegant   letter   was that   which   contain'd   an   account   of   your   being grown   fat .   You   will   expect   that   I   should   tell   you   my next   wish   is   to   hear   you   are   grown   rich ,   that   as I   prefer   embonpoint   to   talents ,   I   prefer   wealth   to virtue ;   but   I   have   not   been   long   enough   in   this   part of   the   World   to   consider   riches   as   a   blessing   equal to   health .   I   think   I   have   rather   lost   some   of   my respect   for   wealth   since   I   was   hither .   Here   is   a   rich state   without   honour   &   glory   among   nations ,   & many   rich   individuals   without   respect   &   regard among   Mankind .   The   sight   of   Holland   is   very amusing ,   it   is   the   disgrace   of   nature   &   honour of   art .   hither Hither   ought   all   statesmen   &   legislators to   repair ;   they   will   see   good   government   &   good laws   go   further   to   make   a   nation   prosper than   soil   &   climate .   The   despotick   Monarch whose   subjects   are   hungry   &   naked   should   see how   the   natives   of   Holland   thrive   in   this   wretched Country ,   while   his   people   starve   in   a   fruitfull   soil . We   had   a   tedious   journey   to   Utrecht ,   from   thence to   Amsterdam   We   went   in   the   States   yatcht ,   our journey   therefore   was   easy ,   &   by   the   novelty   of the   objects   pleasant .   We   staid   a   whole   day   at Amsterdam   which   as   a   place   of   trade   is   astonishing but   I   should   as   soon   wish   myself   a   Carrier   who   sets   up   at the   White   horse   or   black   Eagle   in   Bishops   gate   street , as   an   Amsterdam   Merchant   always   to   travel   never   to   rest ,   &   always   to   get   &   never to   enjoy ,   is   absurd ;   &   these   mony   getting   people ,   who live   with   their   noses   over   a   ditch ,   are   amongst those   whom   Satan   cheats   out   of   this   World .   We came   in   a   States   yatcht   from   Amsterdam   to   the Hague ,   almost   the   whole   way   we   saw   fine   Houses &   gardens ,   that   is   to   say ,   houses   &   gardens   of   expence , but   in   so   wretched   a   taste   I   should   prefer   a cottage   &   a   green   field   to   the   best   of   them .   I   know not   how   it   is ,   but   the   countenances ,   the   language , the   edifices   of   these   people   give   me   pain .   The Hague   is   realy   very   pretty ,   &   by   being   the residence   of   Foreign   Ministers ,   the   Court   & the   States ,   I   believe   it   is   not   a   very   unpleasant   place to   live   in .   Not   that   I   should   even   stay   here   six Months ,   unless   London   Paris   &   Rome   should   be burnt   down   to   the   ground .   I   was   much   pleased   this morning   with   seeing   Mr   Fagels   library .   he He   has   a   fine   collection of   books   &   medals   &   drawings .   to To   meet   the   Muses   &   the beaux   arts   in   the   house   of   ye   Greffier   of   this   rich Republick   gave   me   great   pleasure .   My   mind   had   been stifled   with   the   idea   of   heaps   of   imprisond   wealth   to   which   elegance never   gave   form ,   nor   liberality   a   vent   .   I   was   delighted to   find   myself   in   a   very   handsome   agreable   house nobly   furnish'd ,   no   foppery   or   ostentation   but   a   modest appearance ,   &   a   handsome   enjoyment   of   riches .   Mr Fagel   seems   a   respectable   man ,   &   his   son   is   a   very pretty   kind   of   young   man .   We   dined   yesterday   with Count   Bentinck   at   his   Country   house ,   where   we were   very   elegantly   entertaind .   Yesterday   Prince Lewis   made   a   most   splendid   entertainment   for My   Lord   Bath .   I   think   we   had   above   an     dishes . His   Highness's   manners   are   peculiarly   obliging and   affable ,   but   I   must   not   give   all   my   praise   to strangers .   Our   Ambassador   Sr   Joseph   Yorke   gave   us a   most   elegant   &   splendid   dinner ,   &   every   mark of   regard   &   polite   attention .   He   lives   generously   &   nobly , &   his   manners   do   more   honour   to   his   station   than his   expence .   He   is   greatly   esteem'd   &   beloved   by   the dutch ,   &   one   must   not   only   be   dull   but   insensible not   to   have   a   sense   of   his   merit ,   which   is   amiable &   agreable   as   well   as   solid .   Yesterday   evening   I went   to   Sr   Joseph   Yorkes   assembly   &   supper ,   at which   we   had   the   Foreign   Ministers   &   the   dutch Ladies   of   distinction .   My   Lord   Bath   &   Mr   Montagu went   to   wait   on   the   Prince   of   Orange   of   whose understanding   they   make   a   favorable   report .   Prince Lewis   takes   more   than   Paternal   care   of   him ,   but   the jealousy   of   the   States   is   such   he   is   kept   up   very strictly ,   it   seems   absurd   than   the   Stadtholder   of   a Republick   should   live   in   in ye   retired   state   of   an   a ick Monarch .   I   am   now   in   an   Inn   at   Rotterdam ,   but in   half   an   hour   shall   be   on   board   the   States   yatch which   is   to   carry   us   to   Moordyck .   If   my   head   is 
BC_1764_EMONTAGU_CL	Sandleford   ye     of   aug My   Lord I   was   in   Surry   with   my   friend   Mrs Boscawen   when   I   received   the   agreable   &   kind   favour   of your   Lordships   letter .   Change   of   place   &   want   of   health   & spirits   made   me   delay   answering   it ,   as   I   was   desirous not   to   do   it   till   I   could   have   the   pleasure   of   writing you   a   long   letter .   My   spirits   &   nerves   suffer'd   greatly from   the   agitation   I   was   in   during   poor   Lord   Baths illness ,   &   the   sad   conclusion   of   it   your   Lordship   will believe   was   not   likely   to   repair   the   mischief   I had   received   by   suspense   &   anxiety .   It   is   true   that his   great   age   might   have   prepared   me   for   the misfortune ,   but   as   his   health   seem'd   every   year to   improve ,   as   he   retain'd   not   only   the   solid   &   strong faculties   of   his   mind ,   but   even   the   witt   quickness &   vivacity   of   youth ,   it   seem'd   as   if   he   was   not   internaly decay'd ,   tho   fourscore   years   had   made   external marks   &   impressions ,   nor   indeed   is   there   any reason   to   apprehend   he   sunk   under   the   weight of   years .   He   was   perfectly   well   the   morning   he   went to   dine   at   Roehampton   at   Lord   Besboroughs ,   he   sat some   time   in   the   garden ,   &   perhaps   might   take   a nap   as   he   returnd   in   the   post   chaise   in   the   evening , as   he   wd   sometimes   do   when   he   was   alone .   He   was   taken chilly ,   &   the   next   morning   with   all   the   appearance of   a   cold :   at   night ,   with   shiverings   &   a   low   fever , for   which   some   warm   medicine   was   given   by   ye   faculty   &   then he   fell   into   a   violent   fever   &   delirium ,   from   which bleeding   &   some   physick   relieved   him ,   &   had   he been   evacuated   perhaps   had   recoverd ,   but   the Doctors   thought   his   age   made   every   fever   fit   very dangerous ,   Dr   Hebberden   &   Warren   attended   but wd   not   sit   up   with   him ,   they   orderd   the   apothecary to   give   ye   bark   if   the   fever   went   off ,   the   apothecaries Son   who   sat   up   with   him ,   did   on   a   remission give   the   bark ,   the   Doctors   approved   it ,   but   finding it   did   not   stay ,   gave   laudanum ;   they   pronounced for   two   days   that   he   was   out   of   danger ,   I   never thought   so   as   by   the   account   even   from   them his   head   was   not   clear ,   on   the   tuesday   bad symptoms   appear d ,   the   Doctors   despaird ,   they   gave wormwood   draughts ,   &   he   lay   in   this   way   for   many days ,   no   efforts   of   nature ,   for   that   could   not   be expected   at   his   great   age ,   &   physicians   will   not hazard   censure   for   the   sake   of   a   patient ,   so from   tuesday   till   saturday   he   lay   in   a   hopeless helpless   state ,   dozing   the   whole   time .   I   must   say I   think   Dr   Warren ,   a   young   healthy   man ,   able   to bear   fatigue ,   &   who   had   had   great   obligations   to Lord   Bath ,   should   have   sat   up   with   him ,   but   he went   every   night   to   Claremont   because   the   Duchess of   Newcastle   thought   herself   ill .   If   one   would   know the   vanity   of   wealth   &   greatness ,   one   need   not   wait for   the   stroke   which   equals   the   King   &   the   beggar , the   sick   bed   brings   them   nearly   on   a   level ,   would not   one   think   all   the   College   of   physicians   would   wait the   crisis   of   the   distemper ?   instead   of   that   the   Son of   an   apothecary   decides   on   the   important   moment as   much   as   for   a   poor   man ;   &   the   state   bed   is not   better   attended   by   Doctors   than   ye   hard   couch &   tape   ty d   curtains ,   but   as   I   do   not   wish   to   quarrel with   these   Gentlemen ,   I   beg   of   you   not   say   you   had these   circumstances   from   me .   I   cannot   but   resent   them for   if   every   thing   had   been   done   as   it   ought ,   & I   had   lost   my   friend ,   the   stroke ,   tho   heavy ,   would have   appeard   from   a   hand   under   whose   chatisements reason   must   bend   with   submission .   My loss   is   indeed   very   great ,   for   my   Lord   Bath   had every   thing   that   one   could   wish   in   a   friend   & a   companion .   His   superiority   of   wisdom   &   fortune his   extraordiny   talents ,   his   great   age ,   did   not   make assume   any   thing   in   society ;   he   was   the   most complaisant   in   his   manners ,   most   gentle   in his   opinions ,   &   most   polite   in   his   behaviour   of any   one   I   ever   saw .   His   sole   defect   ( &   who   alas   is   perfect ! ) was ,   that   his   bounty   was   not   equal   to   his   fortune , at   the   same   time   he   lived   nobly ,   &   often   did   very generous   things .   I   never   apply'd   to   him   for   any one   in   distress   that   he   did   not   readily   &   generously relieve   them ,   &   to   merit   not   well   provided   for I   have   seen   him   make   noble   presents .   Your   Lordship has   been   misinform'd   as   to   his   leaving   Dr   Douglas the   reversion   of   the   Shropshire   estate .   He   left   ye   Pulteney estate   &   all   his   money ,   &   the   Beddfort   estate ,   to General   Pulteney ,   but   if   the   Genl   does   not   by deed   or   will   dispose   of   ye   Bradford   estate ,   then it   is   to   go   to   Mr   Coleman   &   his   male   heirs ,   but Dr   Douglas   has   nothing   to   do   with   it .   To   Mrs Johnstone   he   left   L ,   to   Dr   Douglas   L   &   his   library , to   me ,   a   pair   of   very   fine   diamond   earrings &   a   ring   he   used   to   wear .   His   Lordship   desired   me to   accept   of   all   his   jewels   when   Ld   Pulteney   dyed , I   refused   them ,   &   then   he   said   he   wd   leave   them to   me ,   I   begg'd   he   would   not ,   for   I   told   him   I   did not   like   that   he   should   put   it   into   any   ones power   to   say   I   had   ever   desired   any   thing from   his   friendship   but   the   honour   &   pleasure it   communicated .   Great   indeed   was   the   happiness I   received   from   it ,   &   the   more   as   Mr   Montagu   had so   great   a   regard   &   so   high   a   veneration   for his   Lordship .   I   could   get   leave   to   go   to   Tunbridge or   Spa   if   Lord   Bath   was   of   the   party ,   &   his company   made   every   society   more   agreable   to Mr   Montagu .   But   I   could   easily   part   with   all schemes   of   diversion ,   the   loss   of   so   kind   so   sincere , so   amiable ,   so   respectable   a   friend   is   a   sad   deprivation . My   friend   Mrs   Carter   was   so   good   as   to   come to   me   while   I   was   in   the   cruel   &   dreadfull   state of   suspense ,   as   soon   as   ever   the   fatal   moment came ,   she   went   with   me   to   my   Brothers   house at   Ealing .   I   then   went   to   Mrs   Boscawens   for   some days ,   return'd   to   London   to   prepare   for   my summers   journey   to   Sandleford ,   where   Mr   Montagu intends   we   should   stay   till   the   winter .   He   is   now in   Town   on   business ,   but   comes   here   the   end of   this   week .   I   am   surprized   his   Steward   has   not   sent   me   an answer   about   ye   matter   he   was   to   enquire   into for   yr   Lordship ;   but   he   promises   to   get   ample information .   Lord   Lyttelton   has   been   entertaining all   the   Duchesses   in   the   Peerage   at   Hagley , &   indeed   it   is   a   place   fit   to   entertain   Princes and   Princesses   from   its   grandeur   &   elegance ,   at the   same   time ,   by   its   sweetness   &   amenity ,   it   is just   the   situation   in   which   Arcadians   Nymphs &   Swains   wd   wish   to   dwell .   This   is   a   very   long letter ,   but   I   coud   not   but   wish   to   renew   a   correspondence which   always   give   me   great   pleasure .   I   hope I   shall   hear   from   your   Lordship   soon .   Mrs   Carter begs   to   present   her   compliments .   I   am   very   happy in   having   her   company ,   but   fear   she   cannot stay   with   me   much   longer ,   as   her   youngest   Sister being   now   married   she   has   ye   care   of   her   Fathers house ,   &   in   spite   of   her   learning ,   is   an   admirable house   wife   ,   can   dearn   a   hole   in   a   nap   as   well   as she   can   make   out   a   deficiency   in   the   Hebrew   text , or   comment   on   a   greek   author .   My   health   is   better than   when   I   came   hither ,   but   my   strength   is not   equal   to   great   shocks ,   however   time   I   hope will   do   a   great   deal   in   restoring   my   health   & spirits .   I   am   with   great   esteem My   Lord   your   Lordships most   Obliged   &   Obedt   Hble   Sert E:   Montagu 
BC_1764_EMONTAGU_EV_1	- Will   my   Dear   Mrs   Vesey   go   with   me   to   morrow   at half   an   hour   after   one   to   Mr   Reynolds   where   my Lord   Bath   is   to   sit   for   his   picture ?   where   ye facetious   author   of   Tristram   Shandy   is   to   make him   smile !   &   where   you   may   see   the   historical picture   in   which   the   Muse   of   Tragedy   &   Comedy are   dis puting   for   Mr   Garrick ?   If   all   these   temptations cannot   allure   you ,   what   more   can   I   offer ? only   in   aid   of   these   great   &   extraordinary   subjects . the   company   of   one ,   who   with   the   rest   of   the World ,   is   Mrs   Veseys   admirer   &   Hble   Servant E   Montagu If   Mrs   Vesey   or   Mrs   Hancock will   be   of   ye   party   there   will   be   room   in   my   coach 
BC_1764_EMONTAGU_EV_2	London   jany   ye   Dear   Madam How   many   thanks   have   I   to   give   you ? How   many   apologies   to   make   you ?   But   you   are too   generous   to   love   thanks ,   you   are   too   good   natured to   want   apologies ,   humble   confessions ,   &   humiliations . However   gratitude   you   will   accept ,   &   repentance you   will   receive ,   &   be   assured   I   have   had   the highest   sense   of   your   goodness ,   &   that   my   omissions in   correspondence   have   been   owing   to   my strange   way   of   life .   The   latter   part   of   my   time in   Northumberland   pass'd   in   business   of a   sort   that   stupified   me   for   the   whole   day , tho   it   imploy'd   only   a   part   of   it .   Just   before Christmass   I   set   out   for   London ,   &   thought   I would   write   to   you   on   the   road ,   &   send   you   a winters   pastoral   in   imitation   of   the   Great German   genius   Mr   Gesner .   But   alas   the Hawthorns   were   all   under   water ,   the   newborn lamb   was   drown'd ;   the   robin   red   breast   would not   sing   his   christmass   Carrol ,   all   nature   was drooping   &   forlorn ;   no   Isicles   glisten'd   on   the trees ,   no   christalized   Lake   or   River   reflected   the Sun   beams .   We   were   envelloped   in   misty   rain   & in   a   melancholly   coach   &   six ,   with   only   my   own maid ,   I   pass'd   eight   days   in   the   dreary journey :   the   roads   hardly   practicable   ,   the waters   hardly   passable .   Imagine   whether   at the   end   of   such   days   journeys ,   the   sight   of   the red   nosed   Landlord ,   &   the   fat   Landlady   at   the   Blue Boar   or   green   dragon   could   revive   my   spirits enough   to   make   me   a   correspondent   worthy Mrs   Vesey ?   When   I   return'd   to   London   after so   long   an   absence   my   friends   visited   me   with assiduity ,   my   acquaintances   with   curiosity ,   they wanted   to   see   whether   I   was   germanized   at Spa ,   Dutchified   at   the   Hague ,   or   frenchified by   lodging   two   nights   at   the   Lion   d'argent at   Calais .   By   this   time   my   friends   find   I am   not   improved ,   &   my   acquaintances   that I   am   not   metamorphosed ,   &   there   is   not   any great   demand   for   me ,   so   I   shall   have   it   in   my power   to   write   often   to   you ,   &   be   assured   that as   far   as   extent   of   paper   &   number   of   letters can   go   towards   it ,   I   will   discharge   my   debt   very soon .   ( I   have   been   very   cautious   in   what   I   imparted to   the   relations   of   the   young   man   about whom   you   have   taken   so   much   kind   &   charitable trouble .   I   would   not   to   serve   my   unworthy   Cousin hazard   Any   thing   for   your   worthy   friend ,   so I   contented   my   self   with   saying ,   the   young Woman   was   of   a   very   good   character ,   &   very modest ,   &   I   did   not   hear   of   any   thing exceptionable   in   the   family ;   but   that   it   would certainly   be   best   if   the   young   man   was   to   reside with   his   own   family ,   who   would   have   more authority   over   him ) .   I   suppose   you   had   rather have   an   account   of   the   health ,   les   dits   &   gestes of   Mrs   Carter ,   Lord   Lyttelton ,   &   our   other   friends that   of   the   fine   cloaths   at   the   Prince   of Brunswicks   wedding .   Mrs   Carter   has   all   the greek ,   all   the   headach ,   &   all   the   humility   she   used to   have .   Lord   Lyttelton   had   acquired   all   he   wanted health ,   &   a   surtout   of   flesh ,   but   he   has   had   a little   fever   lately   which   has   for   the   present impaired   his   health   &   worn   his   surtout   a little   thread   bare .   His   speech   on   Privilege ,   in the   House   of   Lords   two   months   ago ,   did   him great   honour ,   &   the   cause   of   virtue ,   decency , &   order ,   great   service .   Lord   Bath   at   these   nuptials has   been   finest   at   every   fine   show   &   frolick'd   it   all the   long   day   .   There   was   as   noble   &   magnificent table   kept   at   Sommerset   house   by   the   Green cloth   for   the   P:   of   Brunswick   before   he   was married ,   to   this   only   the   Lords   of   the   Household &   the   great   State   of   officers   were   invited ,   except Lord   Bath ,   whom   the   King   order d   to   be   put   on the   list   as   having   known   &   entertaind   his Highness   abroad .   Great   dinners ,   crouded   drawing rooms ,   &   a   very   long   day   at   ye   House   of Lords   on   tuesday ,   after   Leicester   House ,   have in   fine   given   his   Lordship   a   cold .   Mr   Tho'   Pitt has   gain'd   great   reputation   by   two   speeches in   the   House   of   Commons .   To   morrow   Mrs   Carter Ld   Lyttelton ,   Sr   James   Macdonald ,   &   Mr Stillingfleet   are   to   dine   with   me ,   but   alas ! Mr   &   Mrs   Vesey ,   &   Mr   Burke   will   not   dine with   me !   And   the   harpies   come   &   spoil   every dish ,   but   leave   me   Mrs   Vesey   & c   they   would not   spoil   my   dinner ,   as   the   destinies   have done ,   by   carrying   you   to   Ireland .   How   often do   we   all   lament   your   absence !   It   will   be quite   unfashionable   not   to   say   something of   our   Princely   wedding .   All   the   World   was   at the   drawing   room ,   all   the   World   was   fine , The   Courtiers   were   fine   because   the   Kings Sister   was   married ,   she   was     be   because   a   German Hero ,   one   who   fought   in   our   Wars   &   did   not negotiate   in   our   Peace   was   to   be   complimented . He   made   a   visit   to   Hayes   where   he   was received   by   a   Patriot   in   flannels .   He   made   a visit   at   Newcastle   House   when   he   was   hugg'd &   kiss'd   by   an   old   courtier ,   tout   paitré   of   courtesy . This   visit   was   indeed   owing   to   a   personal   acquaintance with   the   Duke   &   D:ss   of   Newcastle   when they   were   in   Germany .   However   it   was   thought in   general   that   the   Prince   coquetted   with   the opposition ,   that   party   wish'd   him   to   stay   longer in   hopes   of   getting   him   to   intrigue   with   them but   his   Highness   wd   have   been   more   prudent   for the   Brother   law   ( besides   being   the   most amiable   man   in   the   World )   is   of   a   condition more   fix'd   &   settled   that   Ministers   or   favorites of   the   people   who   are   the   gilded   insects   of   a summers   day .   I   never   suffer'd   so   much   from   a croud   as   on   the   Queens   Birthday ,   &   I   have   got a   cold   which   does   not   seem   disposed   to   quit   me tho   its   violence   is   abated .   Mrs   Pitt   has   been at   Bath   &   is   come   back   to   us   in   pretty   good health .   I   am   to   spend   tomorrow   evening with   her .   Lady   Primrose   is   pretty   well .   Lady Hervey   has   had   the   gout   severely .   Lady   Cardigan seems   in   better   health   than   usual . I   am   glad   you   are   got   to   Dublin .   The   Cave of   Malvina   is   not   delightfull   this   weather . I   grieve   for   your   Patrician   trees   so   great   &   good . &   I   wish   the   Winds   were   allow'd   their   rude romps   only   on   the   bleak   &   barren   mountain &   sportive   zephirs   alone   were   to   play   in   your Paradise .   Ten   thousand   thanks   for   your   charming letters .   I   will   send   you   a   London   gazette frequently   I   know   when   one   is   at   a   distance one   loves   to   hear   news   of   ones   acquaintance . ) Lady   Harriet   Grey   is   with   child .   of   all   the figures   in   the   drawing   room   on   the   wedding the   most   conspicuous   was   our   friend   Monsey he   was   unhouzel'd ,   disappointed ,   unaneal'd , he   look'd   like   a   felo   de   se corpse   on   the   Highway   there   was a   dispute   whether   he   got   his   wig   off   a   gibbet or   took   it   from   a   cherry   tree ,   But   most   surely   he was   neither   in   soft   raiment   purple   fine   linnen nor   in   such   apparel   as   men   in   Kings   Houses . The   post   bell   rings   so   for   the   present   adieu My   dear   Madam !   at   the   feast   of   shells   the   musick of   your   voice ,   the   gentle   vivacity   of   your   witt   will be   wanted .   We   will   raise   the   song   in   your   praise . I   am   Dear   Madam Your   most   obliged Obedient   &   affectte Hble   Servant E.   Montagu 
BC_1764_EMONTAGU_EV_3	Hillstreet   ye     Dear   Madam I   receive   such   charming   letters   from the   blue   stocking   Lodge ,   that   I   begin   to   be   jealous   for the   Original   Society .   You   seem   to   imitate   the   jesuits   of Paraguay ,   who   became   infinitely   more   rich   &   great than   the   Country   from   whence   they   went   out   a   small colony .   The   imitation   of   Dr   Young   is   admirable ,   I   may say   the   imitation   is   in   inimitable   for   it   has   all   possible marks   of   resemblance   and   yet   is   not   mere   misticity &   that   is   hard   to   hit .   I   find   Mr   O   Hara   reveres   as he   ought   the   blue   stockings   of   the   Paripatetick   philosophers ; Mr   Caulfield   the   blue   hose   which   encircles   the nimble   &   taper   leg   of   one   jolie   paisanne   .   I   am   not sure   therefore   that   he   is   worthy   of   our   society ,   however as   he   may   be   only   an   elegant   spectator   of   forms ,   or consider   blue   stockings   as   the   least   deviation   from the   simplicity   of   the   golden   age ,   I   am   glad   he   is received   into   the   Lodge   ,   &   I   think   we   may   admit   him of   the   Colledge   in   time .   Your   kind   concern   for   my health   makes   me   think   it   of   importance   enough to   tell   you   it   is   much   improved   since   I   drank the   Geronstere   waters ;   I   will   not   represent   it   as perfectly   good ,   but   I   have   spirits   enough   for   my   modes of   life ,   I   should   not   be   able   to   go   to   three   assemblies , a   Ball ,   &   a   supper   every   night   as   I   hear   is   the   fashion   at   Dublin this   winter .   However ,   tho   I   have   not   for   some   days   been so   well   as   usual ,   yet   I   was   at   a   great   dinner   at My   Lord   Baths   on   sunday .   Yesterday   I   had   Lady Louisa   Farmer ,   Lady   Sophia   Carteret ,   &   Mrs   Howe , Mrs   Carter ,   Count   de   la   Marmosa   ye   Sardinian Minister ,   Mr   de   Feronce   ye   Brunswick   Minister ,   a Mr   de   Blum ,   &   Mr   Cambridge   at   dinner   ,   Ld   Lyttelton   was   to   have been   of   ye   party   but   was   indisposed .   To   day   my Lord   Bath ,   Mrs   Pitt ,   Ld   Lyttelton ,   Mrs   Carter ,   Mr Stillingfleet ,   &   Mr   &   Mrs   Johnstone   are   to   dine   with me ,   Last   night   I   had   a   card   table ,   as   I   had   a   great addition   of   company   in   the   evening .   I   ask'd   Lady Primrose   to   dine   with   me   but   her   Ladyship   was engaged .   Alas   my   dear   Madam   you   cannot   imagine how   you   are   regretted   at   every   feast   of   shells !   the bards   lament   you   in   measure ,   your   Humble Servant   in   prose   periods   of   all   lengths ,   sometimes it   is   only ,   ah   if   Mrs   Vesey   were   here !   at   others , When   some   who   have   not   the   honour   of   knowing you   are   of   the   party ,   I   try   to   make   them   apprehend what   that   Mrs   Vesey   is ;   &   I   should   never   have   the vanity   to   think   I   did   justice   to   my   original   if Mrs   Carter   did   not   give   one   of   her   innocent   smiles &   cry ,   ay ,   yes ,   ay   indeed !   so   she   is !   Then   I   am   satisfied that   I   have     succeeded pretty   well ,   having   touch'd   the picture   not   with   art ,   but   con   amore .   Lady   Cardigan is   to   give   a   ball   on   monday   sennight .   You   ask   me if   I   was   at   Mrs   Pitts   ball ,   indeed   I   was ,   but   do not   expect   a   description   of   it .   It   was   all   feérie , The   whole   Town   comprehended   within   two   small rooms   and   no   croud ,   no   heat ,   Les   jeux   &   les   ris   were Masters   of   the   revel ,   all   was   gay ,   all   was   pretty , a   great   supper ,     guests ,   they   sat   at   their   ease , the   table   wd   have   held   ten   more ,   the   room     more , Mr   Walpole   wrote   her   a   letter   ye   next   day   of which   she   has   promised   me   a   copy   for   you ,   he   tells her   the   company   at   her   ball   shrunk   like   ye Spirits   in   Pandemonium ,   &   between   his   lovely witt   &   the   sublime   of   Milton ,   the   Ball   will long   exist   in   story .   The   Duchess   of   Queensberry had   a   ball   last   week ,   &   a   very   fine   one ,   but   it was   in   the   way   of   common   human   things , every   person   occupied   a   certain   number   of Square   feet ,   &   there   was   no   croud   because   the Size   &   dimensions   of   the   room   bore   a   natural proportion   to   the   number   of   persons .   every   thing was   very   fine ,   but   nothing   supernatural .   I   met Lady   Cardigan   to   day   at   Mrs   Pitts ,   her   Ladyship is   in   very   good   health ,   Lady   Betty   is   in   very great   beauty .   The   Duchess   of   Portland   has   a terrible   cough   &   has   been   blisterd ,   but   I   hope   is growing   better .   There   is   a   report   that   the   D:   of Portland   is   to   marry   Lady   Waldegrave ,   but   of this   I   am   not   at   all   convinced ,   &   would   not have   my   name   quoted   on   the   occasion .   Lord Suffolk   is   certainly   to   marry   Miss   Trevor .   Mr Hampden   Trevors   daughter ,   they   are   such   a   pair as   Cupid   may   with   a   good   grace   present   to Hymen .   Accuse   me   not   of   delaying   Sr   James   Macdonalds peregrinations .   He   is   wiser   than   Telemachus . I   am   not   quite   so   young   &   fair   as   Eucharis ,   he may   travel   over   the   whole   habitable   globe without   my   having   interest   enough   to   make him   saunter   away   a   day .   I   hear   he   has   got into   the   best   society   at   Paris ,   &   I   dare   say   will be   well   amused     much   esteem'd   amongst them .   I   have   this   evening   received   a   letter   from Mr   Lyttelton   at   Bologna   in   his   way   to   home . He   gives   me   a   charming   account   of   Italy ,   I   dare say   he   will   be   much   improved   by   his   travels . for   the   strength   &   energy   of   his   mind   will   not suffer   him   to   be   too   much   captivated   by   the charms   of   luxury ,   &   the   lesser   arts .   His   mind   seems a   native   of   antient   Rome ,   a   short   abode   in modern   Rome   will   only   soften   &   polish   it   as   one   could wish .   Miss   Lyttelton   grows   more   amiable   &   agreable every   day .   I   give   you   a   particular   account   of all   your   friends ,   for   I   know   when   one   is   seperated by   a   great   distance   from   people   for   whom   one interests   oneself ,   it   is   agreable   to   hear   what   they are   doing .   You   enquire   after   books ,   the   press   has furnish'd   little .   I   will   order   Dodsley   to   send   you Mr   Hurds   dialogue   on   the   use   of   foreign travel ,   which   I   think   extreamly   sensible ,   and the   style   &   character   of   the   speakers   very well   sustain'd .   I   met   yr   friend   Miss   Dashwood   ye night   before   last   at   the   Duchess   of   Beauforts . Now   for   my   chapter   of   politicks ,   which   will not   be   like   Machiavel ,   or   AntiMachiavel ,   but a   mere   relation   of   what   I   have   heard .   Divisions on   the   Cyder   tax   in   ye   house ,   in   which   the Ministry   had   a   Majority   of   only   ten ,   made   people imagine   there   would   be   some   change ,   the   opposition Stirr'd   up   their   war   battle   singing , double   double ,   toil   &   trouble , fire   burn ,   &   Cauldron   bubble ,   and   the fire   crackled ,   &   the   cauldron   bubbled ,   but   the bubble   burst .   Mr   Grenville   so   dextrously   untyed the   budget   the   other   day ,   &   let   out   so   many hopes ,   &   kept   down   so   many   fears ,   wisely   taking the   contrepied   of   Madame   Pandora ,   that   all people   were   contented .   He   began   by   a   very   agreable assurance   that   the   prize   money   which   the King   had   given   to   the   publick ,   &   the   money the   bank   was   to   pay   for   the   renewal   of their   term   &   ye   increase   of   customs   wd   answer   the   expences   of   this   year then   he   gave   some   account   of   what   should be   done   in   our   Colonies ,   &   that   they   might   for the   future   by   paying   some   taxes   cease   to   be a   burthen   to   the   Mother   Country ,   while   the manufactures   they   wd   take   of   us   wd   be   beneficent to   both .   Then   he   talk'd   of   economy   &   the   House said   hear   him ,   &   in   short   all   people   thought he   spoke   ably   &   well ,   &   eloquence   being   at that   time   reposing   in   a   Couch   in   Jermyn Street ,   &   Witt   being   gone   down   with   Mr   Charles Townshend   to   Cambridge ,   to   sollicit   votes   for Lord   Hardwicke ,   no   one   gainsay'd   the   Minister , and   he   now   sits   higher   in   peoples   opinion   & safer   in   his   own   than   he   has   yet   done ,   &   the War   kettle   make   only   a   mess   of   soup   maigre for   this   season .   Ld   B-   has   been   in   town   to make   the   Ministers   kiss   &   be   friends   for   they were   a   little   at   variance .   I   must   tell   you that   one   of   the   Cyder   days   Velters   Cornwall told   the   House   he   would   fight   in   the   straits and   stand   in   the   gap   like   Epaminondas ,   which diverted   every   body   but   Mr   Glover ,   who   liked not   to   sit   by   &   hear   Leonidas   robb'd   of   his   glory . We   have   had   two   new   Oratories ,   the   first   calld Deborah   which   I   hear   was   very   fine .   The   other Nabat   was   perform d   last   night ,   &   I   thought   the musick   very   fine ,   but   the   words   &   musick were   not   always   at   unison .   I   shall   write   you an   account   of   Lady   Cardigans   ball .   The   Duchess of   Queensberry   opend   hers   herself   by   a   minouet with   Ld   Huntingdon .   I   have   sent   you   some poetry   verses   made   by   a   very   pretty   young man ,   Mr   Jernigan .   Pray   send   yr   agreable visionaire   here ,   for   people   in   general   are   too little   visionary ,   &   talk   common   sense   &   matter of   fact   till   one   is   tired   to   death .   I   think   I   have given   you   all   the   frivolités   of   our   World ,   they are   not   worthy   admittance   to   ye   Cave   of Malvina ,   but   at   Dublin   you   will   say   c'est   comme   chez   nous .   Pray   make   my   compts to   Mr   Vesey ,   Mrs   Hancock   &   Mr   Burke ,   I   am   dear madam   Ever   yours 
BC_1764_EMONTAGU_EV_4	Sandleford June   ye   Dear   Madam In   the   coalmines   in   Northumberland !   I   scorn your   words   Madam ,   I   am   on   a   Hill   in   Berkshire star   gazing .   Do   you   think   I   want   to   be   Lady   of   the Bedchamber   to   Queen   Proserpine   or   left   handed   wife to   grim   Pluto ?   No ,   I   am   where   Universal   Pan knits   with   the   graces   &   the   hours   in   dance leads   on   th'   eternal   spring .   I   chose   to   hurry   over   part   of my   history   as   there   is   a   page   in   it   of   stupid   ingratitude which   tells ,   as   how ,   I   neglected   to   answer   the   most charming ,   most   agreable   letters   in   the   world .   We   will throw   that   page   to   the   bottom   of   ye   Letheanlake   if   you   please . You   must   know   my   dear   Madam ,   on   the   sixth   of   may   our good   friends   Mrs   Carter   thought   it   time   to   go   into   the country   to   make   may   garlands ,   in   which   perhaps Apollo   promised   to   mix   a   little   bags .   The   Earl   of   Bath , call'd   by   the   spirit   stirring   drum   of   the   Shrewsbury Militia ,   went   soon   after   to   see   that   his   Regiment were   able   to   kill   our   enemies ,   if   we   had   any .   Lord Lyttelton   did   not   quite   leave   Town ,   but   he   was making   excursions   from   it   Mrs   Boscawen   retired   into Surry   to   enjoy   her   pretty   place ,   &   oh   barbarous   cruel   desertion some   blue   stocking   philosophers   went   to   fish   for   polypes in   ditches ;   others   to   cull   simples   in   the   fields ;   the Poets   to   gather   new   blown   similies   in   the   meadows &   gardens :   Prose   writers   to   meditate   &   season   in   solitude . Now   what   could   I   do ?   Why   truly   I   thought   after   a summers   campaign   in   Germany ;   a   quarter   of   year of   plodding   business   in   Northumberland :   part   of a   winter   &   the   whole   spring   in   the   turbulent   joys   of society ,   a   little   quiet   &   solitude   would   repair   my health   &   spirits ,   which   in   the   various   bustle   of   resort were   all   too   ruffled   &   somewhat   impair'd .   Mr   Montagu I   found   wd   not   come   to   Town   till   ye   middle   of   june , so   about   three   weeks   ago   I   came   to   this   place   without any   company   to   drive   away   l'ennui   .   but But   l'ennui   has been   too   proud   &   too   generous   to   insult   a   poor   defenceless Woman   in   her   solitary   garden ,   and   chuses   a   nobler walk   round   the   great   room   at   Ranelagh ,   up   &   down Marybonne   or   Vauxhall   gardens ,   or   treads   the   polite circle   of   assemblies   where   old   manage   with   great   thrift   certain number   of   square   feet ,   people   are   desired   to   come   without hoops ,   if   agreable .   The   first   week   I   came   hither ,   the   blooming May   had   all   her   charms   and   as   all   Lovers   like   a   tete   à tête   The   lone   admirer   of   rural   beauty   must   do   so .   I   rose pretty   early   to   catch   the   morning   song   of   the   lark ,   then enjoy'd   the   full   chorus   of   the   advanc'd   day   which   at the   hot   meridian   hour   gives   place   to   the   humm   of   the insect   race ,   with   these   I   retired   to   archéd   roofs   of   twilight   groves and   shadows   brown ,   that   sylvan   loves . In   the   evening   I   went   out   in   my   post   chaise ,   admired the   prospects   gilded   by   the   setting   sun   in   some   places , darkend   by   the   lengthen d   shadows   in   others ,   drove   thro' the   villages   when   the   labourer   was   returnd returning   from   his work ,   the   children   from   school ;   the   cows   going   from   milking to   their   pasture ,   &   the   sheep   retiring   to   the   fold .   From these   the   mind   catches   the   lone   of   peace   &   a   disposition to   repose ,   &   I   used   to   return   to   my   dressing   room   pass   an   hour   or   two reading   till   the   night   had   hung   forth   her   golden   lamps . &   Philomel   began   to   channt   her   love   labourd   song ,   then I   took   another   walk   in   my   garden ,   &   it   gave   me   a   still more   sublime   pleasure   than   that   in   the   morning .   For   as in   the   morning   one   joins   the   animal   oration   ,   &   walks   in their   society ,   at   night   imagination   leads   one   among   the invisible   &   spiritual   creatures ,   but   the   mystick   pleasures of   a   reverie   cannot   be   explain'd   so   here   I   will   stop   my fairy   tale   &   least   you   should   envy   me ,   if   you   are   at   Dublin , I   will   confess ,   I   am   now   sitting   by   the   fireside .   A   northeast Wind   has   blasted   all   the   rural   scene ,   &   the   garlands on   the   brow   of   may   began   to   fade   a   week   ago .   I   have nothing   left   to   recommend   my   situation   but   its   undisturbed quiet   &   who   ever   valued   that   blessing   after   a   weeks   enjoyment of   it !   so   I   shall   go   back   to   Hillstreet   in   a   few   days . With   great   provision   of   health   &   spirits   acquired   by   much exercise   &   a   wonderfull   epargne   of   conversation ,   I   have made   &   received   but   few   visits ,   however   last   night   I   might have   been   at   a   Ball ,   for   the   Militia   officers   gave   a very   splendid   one   on   his   Majesties   birth   day ,   and   the other   day   as   I   was   walking   in   the   garden ,   I   had   a   ticket presented   me   with   Col   Vansitarts   compliments .   An   invitation to   a   Wake   sent   me   in   Hillstreet   would   not   have supprized   me   more ,   than   a   ticket   for   a   ball   at   Sandleford I   am   at   present   a   butterfly   in   the   Nymph   state ,   & can   neither   shine   nor   flutter ,   &   then   what   can   one   do at   a   ball ?   I   sent   an   apology   which   I   repeated   to   Col Varsitart   on   Sunday   after   Church ,   but   even   on   that good   day ,   &   in   that   good   place ,   he   would   not   believe   that I   spoke   truth   when   I   assured   him   I   staid   at   home   merely   for   want   of   dress ,   but   indeed I   had   brought   down   nothing   but   night   gowns ,   as   my   stay was   to   be   short . Last   post   brought   me   a   letter   from   Mrs   Carter   in   which she   complain'd   of   your   long   silence .   This   post   will   carry yours   to   her .   I   long   to   imitate   the   post   office   &   read   it   first ,   but as   I   could   not   pretend   to   peep   into   it   to   prevent   treason &   conspiracy   I   was   forced   to   forbear . Lord   Lyttelton   has   been   at   Mr   Stanleys   but   I   believe   returns to   Town   for   the   Birthday ,   he   has   happily   miss'd   his   spring   fever &   I   hope   the   season   is   now   so   far   advanced   he   will   keep well .   Lord   Bath   still   profits   by   l'eau   de   jouvenance   he drank   at   Spa ,   for   last   week   I   had   the   drollest   &   wittiest letter   from   him   I   ever   saw ,   written   the   day   after   the Review   of   his   Regiment ,   when   he   said   he   had   He   saluted   by   six   hundred   men   in   the   morning   &   had saluted   two   hundred   Ladies   in   the   evening . He   was   in his   coach   upon   the   field   from   eight   in   the   morning   till two ,   then   did   the   honours   of   a   great   ball   &   all   this in   the   most   sultry   day   we   have   had   this   year .   He   has been   keeping   open   House   three   weeks   at   Shrewsbury Floods   have   been   drain'd ,   Forrests   depopulated ,   Hecatombs of   Oxen   slain   for   the   substantial   part   of   his   dinners , &   the   mills   of   many   dairies   whipt   into   syllabub   or consolidated   into   custard   for   the   desserts ,   all   this   may be   done   without   exhausting   his   purse ,   but   how   his spirits ,   or   indeed   how   any   one   can   go   through   so   much fatigue   I   cannot   imagine .   Yesterday   sennight   not   only all   the   Shropshire   Squires   were   to   dine   with   him   but all   the   noble   race   of   Shinkin ,   &   all   the   descendants   of King   Cadwallader   from   every   mountain   &   valley   in Wales .   I   wish   the   great   Talliessin   could   have   come   with   his harp   to   have   sung   the   praise   of   the   noble   Lord   of the   feast . I   have   hear'd   great   praise   of   a   letter   of   Ld   Palmerston's   from some   Town   in   Italy   the   Genius   of   Sr   William   Temple seems   to   bloom   out   again   in   this   descendant . You   may   imagine   that   I   am   very   ignorant   of   the   state of   the   political   World   at   present .   I   suppose   even   the War   battle   fire   will   go   out   till   rekindled   from   some   spark   struck   by   the   collision of   parties   in   Parliament   next   winter .   Mr   Pitt   is   in very   good   health ,   able   to   go   to   plow   this   summer ,   &   will be   as   fit   for   the   Dictatorship   in   Winter . The   tragedy   you   mention   is   a   Dreadfull   one .   The   Lotharios are   a   sad   race ,     a   fain   Penitent   in   a   Castle   has time   to   weep   over   her   guilt   &   misfortunes ,   but   in   gay society   they   endeavor   too   often   to   forget   the   first   inconstant &   the   first   crime ,   by   a   second   Lover   &   a   second   transgression I   have   often   thought   it   happy   for   us   Women   we are   not   call'd   Cuckolds   if   our   Husbands   are   naughty , one   half   the   misfortune   lies   in   an   ugly   name .   If   the fine   Gentleman   who   has   occasion'd   all   this   misfortune has   any   feeling   he   must   be   more   wretched   than   the man   he   has   injured   can   possibly   be ,   for   Providence has   taken   care   innocence   can   never   feel   the   scorpion sting   of   remorse . I   have   watch'd   the   press   for   you   but   it   has   of   late been   very   much   engaged   in   politicks ,   &   the   Muses   who hate   party ,   are   retired   to   some   more   peaceable   Country . Worcestershire   is   certainly   the   land   of   Poets ,   &   there is   a   good   collection   of   verses   publish'd   by   a   journey Man   cobler   in   that   Country .   He   is   far   above   Stephen Duck .   I   got   a   good   deal   of   money   for   ye   poor   man ,   & have   sent   him   books   with   advice   not   to   quit   good St   Crispin   patriarchy   for   the   Pagan   Muses . I   beg   my   compliments   to   Mrs   Hancock ,   Mr   Vesey ,   & Mr   Burke .   When   do   you   all   return   to   us ?   The   echoes of   Sandleford   repeat ,   Return   to   us .   I   can   say   nothing more   from   my   heart   than   again   answer   to   ye echo ,   Return   to   us ,   so   when   ever   you   think   of   me be   assured   Echo   &   I   are   calling   out ,   return   to   us ! Ever   Dear   Madam Most   affectly   yrs E Montgu I   beg   of   you   to   send   ye   enclosed to   Mrs   Delany 
BC_1764_EMONTAGU_GL	Bath   thursday   ye   of   Dec:   My   Lord When   I   wrote   last   to   your   Lordship I   was   in   hopes   I   should   have   been   in   Town   almost as   soon   as   you   will   receive   this   letter ;   but   having got   a   cold ,   &   the   weather   being   very   bad ,   I   am much   press'd   by   my   friends   to   stay   two   or   three days   longer .   I   do   not   think   I   should   run   much hazard   in   travelling ,   but   there   have   been   such bad   colds   stirring   as   more   induces   me   to   submit   to discreet   advice .   I   was   obliged   on   Mr   Montagus   acct to   defer   my   journey   till   to   day ,   as   he   was   not   to be   at   Sandleford   till   this   day ,   &   the   weather   is terrible ;   I   hardly   ever   knew   a   more   terrible   storm of   wind   &   rain ,   than   there   is   without ,   &   within , I   have   been   in   as   violent   a   shower   of   Soot   as   ever overwhelm'd   a   poor   chimney   sweeper .   We   should be   very   dull   here ,   if   you   did   not   from   London send   us   extraordinary   news   of   separations . Hymens   bands   are   often   broken ,   but   the   dissolving   a charm   work'd   with   more   art   than   Witches   put   into their   philters   &   enchantments   is   a   surprizing event .   Venus   put   into   it   her   tricks   &   her   arts ,   her   quips , &   cranks ,   &   wanton   wiles ,   Bacchus   threw   in   many a   flask   of   Burgundy   &   champagne ,   Ceres   brought good   dishes   to   the   feast ,   &   Comus   a   merry   catch ,   &   after all   this   comes   a   divorce   for   bed   &   board .   I   did   not imagine   there   was   much   sentiment   or   even gallantry   in   the   connection ,   but   I   imagined   his Grace   dined   with   the   Dame   because   she   gave   the best   dinners ,   &   slept   with   her   because   she   had the   best   french   Matrasses .   The   connections   of   pleasurable vice   are   very   short ,   but   there   is   a   sort   of lazy   brutish   Volupté   that   snares   out   a   Century , being   too   lazy   for   reformation ,   &   too   brutal for   repentance .   This   I   imagined   to   be   the   state   of this   illustrious   pair ,   for   a   pair   they   will   be ,   if they   should   live   under   a   different   Hemisphere . There   is   certainly   a   happy   assortiment   of   character or   they   could   not   have   lived   so   long   together . I   am   grievously   tired   of   the   dull   diversions   of this   place ,   but   was   well   amused   the   other   day by   a   lecture   upon   Heads   given   by   one   Stevens who   was   a   player .   He   gave   us   an   hour   of   witty well   bred   satire .   This   man   is   far   superior   to   Mr Foote   whose   humour   consists   only   in   mimickry . I   shall   attend   him   again   tomorrow ,   which   is   a sign   I   am   well   pleased   with   an   entertainment one   should   naturally   suppose   could   amuse   but once . I   am   going   to   dine   with   my   friend   Mrs   Boscawen , who   has   received   great   benefit   from   her   journey &   change   of   air .   I   think   the   Bath   water   has   done me   much   good .   I   have   sent   to   day   a   letter   to Sandleford   to   desire   my   letters   may   be   convey d hither   immediately ,   in   hopes   of   having   one   that may   inform   me   your   Lordship   has   got   rid   of your   cough .   The   post   may   bring   my   letters   on   saturday morning ,   &   I   imagine   I   shall   not   venture   to   set out   before   monday ,   as   my   cold   is   only   in   its beginning ,   &   colds   with   me   are   generally   very severe   for   a   few   days ,   tho   without   fever   or   coughs , but   always   accompanied   with   great   heaviness &   pain   in   my   head ,   which   makes   travelling very   painfull . I   have   had   a   charming   letter   from   one   Crispin , &   some   verses   which   are   to   be   submitted   to   your Lordships   corrections .   He   boasts   of   your   visit   & goodness   to   him ,   I   am   glad   he   is   to   come   to   London . I   shall   trouble   your   Lordship   with   another   letter as   soon   as   I   can   tell   the   day   I   shall   be   in London .   Your   Lordship   will   do   me   a   great   favour if   you   will   send   the   enclosed   to   our   Porter in   Hillstreet . I   am   my   Lord Your   Lordships most   Obliged   &   Obedt   Humble   Servt E Montagu 
BC_1765_EMONTAGU_EV_1	Sandleford   ye     of   june My   dear   Madam I   imagine   this   will   find   you   so busy   in   your   sylpheries   at   Lucan   you   will   hardly   deign to   look   upon   it .   Some   of   your   Cousins   the   zephyrs   will be   whispering   des   vrais   douceurs   through   an   orange   tree to   you ;   or   your   handmaids   the   Nairdes   will   be   pointing out   a   crystal   stream   before   you ,   or   perhaps   a   wood   nymph will   have   brought   a   basket   of   moss   to   adorn   some favorite   rock ,   &   my   poor   letter   will   be   thrown   aside .   I   am not   like   a   sylph   ranging   the   air   &   commanding   the elements ,   nor   even   like   a   Pastoraller ,   listening   to   the soft   strains   of   a   Corydin ,   but   like   the   merest   Country Gentleman   you   ever   know   &   much   unworthy   to   correspond with   your   divinity   ship   in   the   hallow'd   bower   of   bliss at   Lucan .   I   did   not   leave   London   till   the     of   june I   found   the   Country ,   as   Harlequin   says ,   very   green the   air   was   soft ,   the   birds   were   tunefull ,   &   I   rejoyced as   one   who   had   been   long   in   populous   City     at   every rural   sight ,   &   rural   sound .   I   resemble   my   favorites   the dutch ,   in   being   well   when   I   am   not   ill ,   pleased   when I   am   not   angry ,   &   glad   when   I   am   not   sorry ,   leaving les   nuances   in   these   matters   to   persons   of   finer   feelings , or   at   least   this   is   the   disposition   I   wear   in   the   Country No   conversationes   do   I   expeckt   here ,   no   stocking   spun   off the   woof   of   philosophy .   I   have   leisure   &   books ,   &   if   to these   health   &   sunshine   are   added ,   I   enjoy   all   I   expect . I   have   lived   entirely   alone   ever   since   I   came   hither , &   I   have   had   my   health   &   eyes   so   good   as   not   find   any spirits   fail ,   but   the   hours   pass   as   those   do   chained   to Auroras   Car   in   the   Picture   of   Guido ,   but   of   this   peacefull life   I   cannot   make   you   any   amusement .   It   is   impossible to   transmit   a   Reverie ,   Mr   Bayes   who   could   pen a   whisper   could   not   write   a   Reverie .   If   written   it   must be   on   the   surface   of   a   moving   stream ,   where   one   part would   vanish   before   the   other   appear'd ,   &   each   passing cloud   threw   a   new   tint   upon   it .   However   these   reveries , the   nightingale   playing   their   symphony ,   &   the stars   or   moon   shedding   soft   uncertain   light   upon them ,   are   very   delightfull ,   &   fun   beyond   the   ordinary dull   realities   of   life .   How   often   had   my   imagination set   sail   for   Ireland ,   &   wafted   me   to   Lucan ;   this   reverie ended   in   a   sigh ,   but   I   protest   I   think   such   an   one as   is   preferable   to   any   horselaugh   that   ever   arose in   the   liberties   of   London   &   Westminster ;   so   let   my Lord   Mayor   of   London ,   &   the   High   Bailif   of   Westminster , take   all   the   horse   laughs   as   part   of   their   Regalia . I   envy   them   no   more   their   broad   mirth   than   I   do their   furr   gowns   on   a   midsummer   day .   I   will own   a   horse   laugh   is   very   good   to   help   to   digest calipash   &   calipee ,   &   all   the   green   fat   of   Turtle ,   therefore at   City   feast   be   it   ever   served   up !   &   grace   the   Grace cup   that   Toasts   the   City   of   London   &   the   trade   thereof . Let   our   spirits   in   absence   gently   meet   in   a   sigh ! as   soon   as   you   left   London   I   was   in   a   hurry   to   depart from   it ,   no   longer   charm'd   with   a   place   where   journey men   Wearers   mutiny   through   hunger ,   &   journey   men minister   ( for   of   late   they   are   only   hired   by   the   day )   rebell because   they   are   waxed   fat   &   full .   I   had   the   pleasure of   Lord   Lytteltons   &   Sr   James   Macdonalds   company two   evenings   after   you   left   me .   Lord   Lyttelton   is   gone to   Wolton   &   Stow   I   am   inform'd .   Sr   James   Macdonald to   the   Country   of   Ossian   for   a   few   days ,   to   see   the zephirs   sporting   with   the   thistles   beard ,   before he   goes   to   the   happy   Lands   where   they   play   in Aromatick   Groves . On   the     of   next   month   I   am   to   go   to   Bullstrode   for a   few   days .   Lord   Lytteltons   new   addition   of   Dialogue is   come   with   four   new   ones   which   I   am   sure   will   charm you .   I   have   not   heard   from   our   dear   Mrs   Carter   since I   came   hither .   I   sent   her   word   of   the   nightingales   you were   transplanting   to   Ireland ,   &   told   her ,   I   did   not doubt   but   your   gratefull   Country   would   erect   a Statue   to   you   with   a   nightingale   on   your   head , which   I   thought   would   Rival   the   Minerva   of   Athens . Indeed   I   like   not   the   inflexible   wise   face   of   an   Owl for   a   Woman ,   the   bird   that   shuns   the   noise   of   folly is   enough   for   the   fair   ,   homely   unpleasant   &   harsh wisdom   should   be   left   to   the   more   boisterous   sex . I   have   so   much   forgotten   all   I   hear'd   of   the   magnificence of   the   Birthday   I   cannot   give   you   an   account   of   it . Lady   Northumberlands   illuminations   were   very   fine but   tho   the   Kings   birth   day   the   Queens   cradle   ( with the   nursing   Muses )   was   portray'd   in   a   fine   emblematica style ,   of   which   the   gazeteer   or   chronicle   will give   you   a   better   account   than   I   can .   My   grey goose   quill   cannot   soar   to   such   sublime   subjects . However   you   see   Lady   Northumberland   ne   boude   pas   . The   ministers   look   very   chagrin .   The   opposition not   desponding .   The   people   with   expecting   faces . I   desire   my   best   respects   to   Mrs   Delany   &   the   Dean , &   also   to   Mrs   Sandford   &   the   Doctor   when   you   see them ,   &   pray   tell   Mrs   Delany   I   wish   her   joy   of Lady   Weymouths   being   Vice   Reine   of   Ireland . Pray   write   to   me   often ,   &   do   not   let   Mr   Vesey   &   Mrs Hancock   forget   me ,   assure   them   I   am   much   their humble   Servant .   I   do   not   know   whether   you   have read   l'expulsion   des   jesuites   par   Mr   d'alembert , if   you   have   not ,   it   is   worth   your   reading . Prey   persevere   in   Dr   Pringles   prescription .   &   take care   of   your   health   for   the   sake   of   your   friends , no   one   can   be   more   tenderly   interested   in   it   than my   dear   Madam your   most   faithfull   affectionate Humble   Servant E Montagu 
BC_1765_EMONTAGU_EV_2	Sandleford   ye     July   My I   had   the   pleasure   of   my   dear   Mrs Veseys   charming   letter   last   post ,   which   would   have made   me   compleatly   happy ,   if   my   conscience   had not   reproach'd   me   that   I   did   not   deserve   it .   In London   there   is   such   a   noise   &   hurley   burley   in   the streets   one   cou'd   hardly   hear   ones   conscience   if   it cried   murder ,   in   the   quiet   of   the   Country ,   one   starts if   it   but   whispers   a   transgression ;   which   perhaps   is the   most   philosophical   account   of   the   great   increase of   the   Town ,   &   the   hundred   new   streets   that   are   building . but   if   any   one   chuses   to   attribute   the   new   squares &   streets   rather   to   our   Colonies   in   Americas   I   give up   my   Hypothesis .   I   cannot   imagine   why   I   omitted to   write   to   the   most   amiable   of   friends   &   the   most entertaining   of   correspondents ,   how   could   I   let   that   other Country   Gentlewoman ,   la   mauvaise   honte ,   persuade me ,   that   one   must   not   write   if   one   could   not   divert ? I   had   ye   delightfull   letter   from   Wales ,   which   has   put it   into   my   head ,   &   into   my   heart ,   that   we   must   travel over   that   Country   together ,   &   I   am   convinced   the ghosts   of   the   drown'd   Bards   will   rise   from   their watery   Bier ,   &   play   over   the   hills   &   far   away , to   warble   their   native   wood   notes   wild .   I   was   ashamed , lolling   on   a   bench   in   my   garden ,   to   send   you   an answer   to   such   a   description   of   your   travels .   If   I would   hearken   to   it   the   same   reason   might   make me   lay   down   my   pen   &   ink   now ,   because   I   live   in a   brick   house ,   go   to   bed   before   the   pert   fairies   &   the dapper   elves   begin   their   sports ,   while   your   life   passes on   the   Muses   bower .   How   is   it   my   dear   friend ,   that   in your   description   of   your   grotto   you   have   taken   the very   quintessence   of   the   Penseroso   &   Allegro ?   leaving out   all   that   is   horrid   in   melancholly ,   all   that is   vulgar   in   mirth .   I   suppose   Sylphs   dip   their pen   in   the   rain   bow ,   where   the   colours   are   united without   being   confounded .   If   I   can   once   obtain   a mossy   seat   in   the   Bower   of   Malvina ,   I   believe   I shall   stay   there   till   the   morning   star   lights   me   home when   By   dimpled   brook ,   &   fountain   brim , The   wood   nymphs   deckt   with   daisys   trim , Their   merry   wakes   &   pastimes   keep , What   hath   night   to   do   with   sleep ? If   I   had   as   many   eyes   as   Argus   you   should   not   persuade me   to   close   one   of   them   in   sleep   in   such   a   scene till   the   babling   Eastern   scout   began   to   discoverd our   Conceald   solemnity ,   when   vulgar   day   broke in   on   our   mysteries ,   I   would   walk   ye   half   mile you   mention   with   great   readiness . I   pass'd   my   time   very   agreably   at   Bullstrode .   The Duchess   has   contrived   to   join   magnificence   with pleasure ,   &   pomp   with   ease .   The   House   &   Park   are greatly   embellish'd   since   I   saw   them ,   &   are   really very   fine ,   but   the   genuine   good   nature   of   the   mistress of   the   place ,   gives   it   a   charm   beyond   what   the features   of   nature   in   the   park ,   or   the   ornaments of   art   in   the   House   can   do .   It   must   delight   a friend ,   but   it   would   please   even   a   moral   philosopher to   see   this   Lady ,   with   the   united   advantages   of birth ,   title ,   &   fortune ,   so   entirely   void   of   the   pride such   things   are   apt   to   infuse :   it   shows   that   good as   her   situation   is ,   there   is   something   in   her superior   to   it .   Her   Menagerie   contains   many very   rare   animals ,   her   garden   many   curious   plants , but   there   is   one   Creature   happy   &   in   his   element there ,   which   I   never   saw   in   full   prosperity   any where   else ,   If   that   is   a   Dependant   Her   Graces behavior   to   Mr   Achard   is   a   Speculation   for   the virtuous ,   as   much   as   a   Phenix   would   be   for   ye Virtuous ,   it   is   indeed   unique .   It   is   the   more commendable ,   because   the   Duchesses   parts   are   so lively ,   &   her   powers   of   conversation   so   much   excell   his , that   she   has   all   kinds   of   superiority   over him ,   but   uses   them   all   only   to   make   his   condition more   happy .   I   found   a   heartfelt   pleasure   in   this and   therefore   placed   it   highest   in   my   history   of Bullstrode ,   now   I   will   proceed .   We   used   to   sit   in   the morning   in   an   open   grove   near   the   House   surrounded by   gold   &   silver   pheasants ,   &   all   the   feathery   race , in   the   evening   we   went   about   ye   Park   in   the Duchess   coach ,   &   got   out   &   walk'd   where   peculiar beauties   of   prospect   or   shade   invited   us .   Mrs Boscawen   &   her   Daughters ,   Lord   Lyttelton   &   his daughter ,   composed   the   party .   The   young   ones went   about   under   the   guardianship   of   Mr Achard ,   who   attended   them   with   great   good   humour . the   rest   of   us   engaged   in   conversation ,   &   the   days   passed away   with   down   upon   their   feet .   as   you   know the   place   I   have   not   attempted   to   describe   it . I   am   sure   you   admire   the   park ,   the   round   hills would   please   the   sublime   &   beautyfull   Burke . You   congratullate   me   on   Mr   Burkes   Secretary   ship , &   indeed   I   should   think   it   a   happiness   for   the   publick if   I   was   not   afraid   he   must   follow   his   chief ,   who probably   will   not   long   keep   his   Post .   I   imagine Mr   Burke   is   singularly   qualified   for   a   place of   business ,   The   dull   always   arrogate   to   themselves the   faculty   of   doing   business ,   &   poor   things   it is   pity   to   mortify   them ,   but   I   think   a   genius can   generally   do   all   that   a   Dunce   can ,   and something   more .   Witt   like   a   lively   school   boy sometimes   plays   truant ,   &   loves   a   holy   day ,   but when   the   roguish   thing   applies   he   learns   his lesson   quick ,   Lord   Lyttelton   will   certainly   prefer the   rural   pleasures   of   Hagley   to   being   in   office in   this   unsettled   state   of   things .   I   hear   some of   our   young   Statesmen   are   already   weary   of their   employments ,   they   do   not   find   Governance so   pretty   a   play   thing   as   they   imagined .   I hope   they   will   be   wiser   than   boys   usually are ;   that   they   will   lay   down   their   play   thing before   they   have   broken   it   to   peices .   The Duke   of   Newcastle   being   in   the   vigour   of   his age ,   &   meridian   of   his   parts ,   is   extreamly happy .   These   are   odd   times :   I   have   seen   Grandams &   their   grand   children   at   quadrille   at   the   same table ;   &   now   Grandsires   &   their   Grandsons   sit at   the   same   Council   table .   Happy   Country in   which   no   man   is   too   old   or   too   young ,   too unacquainted   with   affairs ,   or   too   much   hackeny'd in   wickedness ,   not   to   be   fit   for   the   highest   trusts in   the   state !   Mr   Pitt   is   at   Sr   William   Pensents Seat .   He   &   his   family   travell'd   with     coaches &   six ,   &   four   post   chaises   &   four ,   &   forty   attendants as   I   am   inform'd .   I   think   this   is   not   travelling   so much   like   a   Patriot   as   a   Patriarch .   Lord   Lyttelton   is at   Hagley ,   where   he   expects   Chiefs   out   of   War   & Statesmen   out   of   place .   All   people   are   sorry   for   the K-   who   made   Mr   Pitt   the   fairest   offers ,   &   such as   he   would   have   accepted ,   but   Ld   Temple   would not   come   in ,   &   Mr   Pitt   would   not   come   in   without him .   There   is   no   board   of   trade   at   all   sitting .   I believe   the   Admiralty   is   not   fill'd   up .   You   will see   a   great   many   strange   stories   concerning the   french   at   Newfoundland   in   the   papers ,   but there   is   little   foundation   for   them   Capt   Paliser   sank   six fishing   boats ,   which   in   Change   Alley   were metamorphosed   onto   as   many   ships   of   the   line , but   a   young   man   who   came   from   Newfoundland in   the   last   ship ,   call d   here   last   week ,   &   assured me ,   these   reports   were   raised   by   stock   jobbers . I   have   sent   yr   letter   to   our   friend   at   Dent .   She   is   still much   teized   with   pains   in   her   head   Virtue   &   wealth   what   are   but   a   name ! I   am   afraid   after   ye   easy   &   unembarass d   countenance of   the   Duchess   of   B- ,   &   the   robust   address   of the   Countess   of   N- , Lady   Hertfords   blushing timid   accueil   will   not   please .   After   these   what can   the   Irish   think   of   a   Lady   who   blushes   & whispers ?   I   have   not   heard   yet   from   the   Son   of Woody   Morven .   He   was   detain'd   there   longer   than he   intended .   He   will   be   a   diamond   of   the   first water ,   when   Italian   suns   have   thrown   their rays   into   his   solid   &   clear   genius .   I   will   communicate some   of   his   letters   if   he   writes   any .   I   am   afraid there   is   no   part   of   the   habitable   globe   in   which young   men   admire   old   Women ,   if   there   be ,   it   must be   in   the   half   years   twilight   of   Greenland ,   &   even there   perhaps   there   is   some   heresy   in   the   good   doctrine of   the   equality   of   Joan   &   my   Lady . I   must   tell   you   Lord   Lyttelton   shew'd   me   with   more pride   &   self   complacency   than   I   ever   saw   in   him a   letter   which   he   said   came   from   a   Lady .   I   read &   said   who   is   this ,   she   writes   in   a   very   superior   style , who   can   it   be ,   the   style   I   thought   I   knew ,   but the   hand   I   did   not ,   for   your   Ladyship   had   so closely   musterd   the   scatterd   form   of   your   alphabet &   put   them   in   such   fair   array ,   that   to tell   you   the   truth ,   if   your   name   had   not   been at   the   bottom ,   or   some   mark   of   Lucan   had   not appeard ,   you   had   lost   the   credit   with   me   of an   incomparable   letter .   We   laugh'd   exceeding at   my   admiration   of   the   letter   without   discovering the   writer .   Prey   tell   Mr   Vesey   that   he   has   all all   the   love   &   esteem   I   can   give   to   such   green   years . He   is   an   unfortunate   man   to   be   too   old   for   a Secretary   of   State   &   too   young   for   a   Lover . Pray   when   you   see   the   Primate   give   my   best respects   to   him . I   am   very   sorry   for   the   disorder   in   your   stomach . The   oyster   shell   powder   has   been   of   great   service   to mine ,   &   living   much   upon   milk   has   done   one   good . I   fear   you   cannot   bear   milk .   pray   avoid   eating acids   &   sugar   mix'd ,   for   they   will   ferment   & hurt   you .   Methinks   the     of   Lucan are   angry   that   I   detain   you   so   long .   I   hope   since the   weather   has   been   cooler   you   have   found   less of   the   languor   you   complain'd   of . I   am   my   dear   Madam Most   affectionately and   faithfully yours E.Montagu Best   respects   to   our amiable   Mrs   Hancock . Mrs   Carter   had   rejoyced me   with   ye   good   news of   your   House   which   I   love better   than   any   Hôtel   that ever   was   built . 
BC_1765_EMONTAGU_EV_3	"Hillstreet   Nov   ye   I   had   the   pleasure   of   my   dear   Mrs Veseys   letter   at   Sandleford   just   when   I   was   in   the bustle   of   preparing   to   leave   it .   Every   moment   the housekeeper   was   breaking   in   upon   me   with   a face   of   care ,   to   consult   my   superior   wisdom ,   what what   was   to   travel   by   broad   wheel   waggon ,   stately &   slow ,   what   was   to   fly   by   ye   rapid   machine . I   came   to   Town   only   in   my   road   to   Mrs   Boscawen . in   Surry ,   so   delay'd   writing   till   I   return'd   to the   busy   World   in   order   to   inform   you   what we   were   doing ,   or   seeming   to   do ,   &   particularly till   I   could   give   you   an   account   of   Lady   Primrose ; of   whom   I   had   not   heard   any   thing   of   almost three   months   before   I   had   your   letter .   I   had   the pleasure   of   hearing   the   Night   before   last   of Mr   Bateman ,   that   day   arrived   from   Windsor , that   she   is   extreamly   well .   She   had   been   a   little indisposed ,   but   was   then   perfectly   recoverd ,   Now my   dear   Madam   there   is   no   man   whose   opinion I   would   take   of   old   Women ,   &   old   china ,   sooner than   Mr   Batemans .   The   toasts   of   the   year ,   &   the   last manufactory   at   Dresden ,   Vincennes ,   &   Chelsea ,   may be   better   understood   by   some   of   your   young   Gentlemen lately   return'd   from   their   travels ,   but   you must   allow   Mr   Bateman   has   attentively   surveyd every   curious   cabinet   of   old   china ,   &   civily visited   the   Ruelle   of   every   old   Lady   of   note for   these   twenty   years   last   past   so   that   he   is   a   perfect Connoisseur   in   these   two   subjects . Now   you   will   expect   I   should   tell   you   some political   news ,   &   what   is   to   fill   up   the   prodigious chasm   made   in   the   administration   by   the   death of   the   D:   of   C- .   But   alas !   those   who   are   much wiser   than   I   cannot   satisfy   your   curiosity ,   all   I can   advise   is   that   you   carefully   consult   Merlins prophesies   for   tho   in   former   times old   experience   did   attain , To   something   like   prophetic   strain , there   is   now   such   a   new   invented   manner   of   doing every   thing ,     that   a   person   must   be   a   down   right Conjurer   or   wizzard   to   guess   what   will   happen .   In   ordinary life   one   knows   that   if   a   dancing   master   removes from   St   James's   street   to   Pallmall ,   he   will   not   write over   his   door ,   Cudgell   playing   &   back   sword   taught here ,   but   in   the   publick ,   a   man   need   only   move from   St   james   Square   to   the   Exchequer ,   or   to   the   admiralty to   be   at   once   a   most   competent   high Commissioner   of   Treasury   or   Admiralty .   Merlin   who has   propheced   of   Rivers   turning   to   dry   Land ,   & terra   firma   becoming   Ocean ,   has   no   doubt   foretold , that   in   this   age ,   all   men   are   fit   for   all   things . &   how   they   shall   possess   &   enjoy   what   mere   human capacity   would   deem   them   unfit   for .   All   I   can   tell you   is   that   there   never   were   times   in   which   the fortunate   had   more   fears ,   or   the   unhappy   more hopes ,   the   Dame   of   the   rolling   wheel   driving with   greater   rapidity   than   she   did   in   former   days . If   I   were   a   Pagan   I   would   erect   a   Temple   to Chance ,   queen   of   the   Century .   There   have   been   times when   Minerva   was   a   better   patroness .   Lord   Lyttelton has   been   in   Town   above   a   fortnight ,   he   is   in   very good   health   &   spirits ,   &   sadly   regrets   that   he   cannot have   the   pleasure   of   raking   till   two   or   three   in the   morning   with   Mr   &   Mrs   Vesey .   You   know   I suppose   that   your   neighbour   Lord   Bute   has sold   his   House   to   Lord   Shelburne .   I   was   at   Badminton this   summer   with   the   Duchess   of   Newport   &   went   from   there to   dine   with   Lady   Shelburne .   I   assure   you   she   seems   to have   made   a   very   good   choice ,   &   I   imagine   she will   be   as   happy   as   the   nature   of   this   life   will allow .   I   am   extreamly   pleased   with   Lord   Shelburne , who   seems   to   have   very   good   parts ,   & c   a   spirit &   activity   which   will   make   him   considerable in   publick   life .   Mr   Adam   &   Mr   Brown   are adorning   Beanwood ,   &   in   time   will   make   it   a fine   place .   You   have   heard ,   I   presume ,   that Lady   Charlotte   Finch   is   obliged   to   seperate   in form   from   Mr   Finch .   He   is   grown   by   age   something between   mad   &   foolish ,   &   hermit   is   said ,   been   guilty of   the   most   cruel   outrages   to   Lady   Charlotte   & his   daughters   even   to   put   them   in   fear   of   their lives . The   Duchess   of   Portland   is   confined   at   Bullstrode by   the   rheumatism .   I   saw   Mr   Burke   a   few   days since ,   he   is   very   well ,   &   I   hope   will   dine   with   me on   friday   with   some   others   who   will   join   in   regretting your   absence .   Mrs   Ann   Pitt   is   grown   plump ,   &   is   in great   health ,   she   has   been   fitting   up   a   little   place at   Knightsbridge   as   a   Country   Seat ,   she   cannot bear   to   retire   to   those   desolate   places . Where   the   gilt   chariot   never   markd   the   way , she   loves   the   track   of   Ministerial   Wheels .   Lady Betty   Germain   is   in   good   health ,   but   has   lost her   memory ,   she   is   now   I   presume   preserved   by the   prayers   of   those   who   live   on   her   County . Lord   Boley   is   in   a   deplorable   way .   I   am   told   he is   the   picture   of   caducity   &   almost   blind . Mr   Pitt   is   at   his   new newly   acquired   Seat   in   Sommersetshire he   has   taken   a   house   at   Bath ,   where   he   will pass   part   of   the   winter   unless   Ld   Temple   shou'd   be prevail'd   on   to   assist   him   in   supporting   the ministerial   offices .   Miss   Stanley   is   determined   to   follow her   sisters   example   in   the   scheme   of   wedlock .   She   is soon   to   be   married   to   a   Mr   D'oyly ,   a   man   of   a   very amiable   character .   I   have   not   heard   from   Sr   James Macdonald ,   but   I   heard   of   him   the   other   day   by Lord   Mount   Stewart ,   who   says   he   is was   at   Geneva about   a   month   ago .   By   the   by   Lord   Mount   Stewart is   return'd   to   us   the   handsomest   &   best   behaved young   man   I   have   seen   in   long   time   amongst our   nobility .   I   believe   you   have   in   Ld   Beauchamp a   young   man   of   fine   parts .   But   I   do   not   know him   personally .   I   have   endeavoured   to   give   you all   the   news   of   the   Town ,   for   I   know   that   contrary to   other   subjects   it   magnifies   by   distance ,   & grows   important   by   the   great   Oceans   dividing it     .   The   moment   I   got   to   Calais   I   began   to   respect the   Whitehall   evening   post   &   Westminster   journal . If   you   have   any   commands   at   the   booksellers , the   Mercers ,   or   the   Milleners ,     any   thing for   the   use   of   the   outward   in   the   inward Woman   send   me   your   commands .   Lady Betty   Eyeston   is   dead .   Lady   Hillsborough   I   hear   is better . I   am   charm'd   with   the   winter   peice   you   painted to   me ,   but   imagine   by   this   time   you   are   get   into a   very   different   scene   at   Dublin .   You   are   extreamly like   the   nightingale ,   no   voice   so   sweet   in   evening   solitude , &   yet   you   can   sing   amidst   the   blaze   of   lights &   company ,   as   Philomela   did   at   Vauxhall . I   had   a   letter   last   saturday   from   Mrs   Carter   who was   well .   I   rejoyce   that   the   time   for   her   coming to   Town   approaches .   I   do   remember   formerly   a   paper call d   the   farthing   post ,   which   dealt   out   all   ye small   news   of   the   World ,   this   writer   I   have   imitated in   order   to   give   you   all   intelligence   of   the   present state   of   this   Town .

BC_1766_EMONTAGU_EC_1	Denton   ye     of   May My   dear   friend I   am   glad   to   find   my   dear   friend feels   a   sympathizing   regret   at   the   distance   at which   I   am   now   from   those   I   love .   I   assure   you   there is   something   desolate   &   melancholly   in   these remote   regions ,   but   I   hope   after   many   rolls   of Phoebus's   car   &   my   post   chaise ,   to   be   restored   to the   persons   &   places   I   grieved   to   abandon . The   love   of   things   ,   of   which   you   accuse   me ,   seems here   to   meet   with   condign   punishment ,   as I   am   in   this   situation   condemn'd   to   ugly   things , &   disagreable   things ,   &   troublesome   things , &   tiresome   things ,   & but   the   reasonableness   &   fitness of   things ,   which   urges   a   Coal   owner   to   be   near the   coal   mines ,   gives   me   spirit   to   go   through all   the   desagrémens   I   meet   with ,   of   which   the living   in   the   noise   of   workmen ,   &   the   litter &   inconveniences   of   a   House   not   half   ready for   my   Servants   is   not   the   least .   I   have   yet only   once   been   able   to   get   out   to   take   ye   air , for   we   have   been   involved   in   continual   mist &   rain ;   whether   this   weather   has   been   general or   confined   to   this   Country   I   do   not   know . I   am   well   situated   for   airing ,   being   on   the edge   of   a   turnpike   road ,   &   the   said   road commands   as   good   a   prospect   as   any   in   this part   of   the   Country ,   but   the   amenity   of our   Southern   Counties   is   not   to   be   found here .   The   people   here   are   little   better   than Savages ,   they   are   dirty ,   their   dwellings   are sordid ,   &   their   countenances   bear   the   marks of   hard   labour   &   total   ignorance .   Our   Pittmen are   litterally   as   black   as   a   coal ,   they   earn much   more   than   labourers ,   their   children get   a   shilling   a   day   at     or     years   old , but   they   are   so   barbarous   &   uncultivated they   know   no   use   of   money   but   to   buy much   meat   &   liquor   with   it .   They   eat   as well   as   the   substantial   tradesmen   in great   Towns ,   but   they   are   ragged   &   dirty , &   their   Wives   are   idle   &   drunken ,   so   that while   they   live   on   plenty   they   present to   your   view   an   air   of   misery ,   poverty , &   oppression .   These   Pitmen   marry   &   multiply in   order   to   be   rich ,   for   their   children   add to   their   prosperity .   They   are   usefull   persons to   the   general   common   wealth ,   but   considerd separately   a   strange   set   of   barbarians   as the   Children   are   so   early   sent   into   ye   mines I   am   afraid   it   will   be   impossible   ever to   civilize   them ,   but   if   I   lived   here   I   should attempt   it   by   establishing   some   little   school amongst   them .   Mr   Wright   went   yesterday to   Scotland   to   a   Colliery   of   ye   Dss   of   Douglas's for   which   he   is   imploy d ,   &   he   does   not   return till   Sunday   night ,   so   in   ye   mean   time I   have   not   any   business   but   looking   after ye   workmen   in   the   House .   I   was   rejoyced   at the   good   account   you   gave   me   of   my   Sister , as   others   think   themselves   sick   when   they are   not   quite   well ,   she   thinks   herself   well when   she   is   not   quite   sick ,   so   kindly   does Providence   contrive   that   habit   shd   lessen the   sense   of   evils . I   hope   the   dissipation   in   which   you   are   obliged to   live   at   Lambeth   will   have   a   good   effect on   yr   health ,   &   it   will   make   you   doubly relish   the   quiet   retirement   of   Deal .   Pray   tell Mrs   Underdown   that   I   have   pityed   her for   yr   absence   ever   since   I   left   London .   She cannot   from   human   virtue   expect   more . While   I   was   in   Town   I   thought   it   highly reason reasonable   that   she   shd   part   with   you   sometimes now   I   am   sensible   she   must   grow   uneasy at   yr   long   absence .   Say   every   thing   that   is affectionate   &   respectfull   for   me   at   Lambeth   & pray   visit   my   Sister   as   often   as   you   can .   I   am glad   yr   heart   does   not   talk   ye   Greek   of   Epictetus .   I   am   ever   y=rs   E M. 
BC_1766_EMONTAGU_EC_2	July   ye     I   am   not   at   all   pleased   with   my dear   friends   account   of   her   health .   What   state   must she   be   in ,   when   she   neither   understands   Aristotle nor   herself ?   The   one   she   can   read   without   help   of a   commentator ,   the   other   without   ye   hindrance   of partiality   &   self   love .   I   am   sorry   I   did   not   bring Mr   Harris .   I   might   scrape   acquaintance   with   Hermes in   this   retirement ,   tho   between   the   care   of   my   health , vulgar   business ,   &   attention   to   Shakespear ,   I   can   pretty well   fill   my   day   without   reading   more   than   is some   way   relative   to   my   work .   What   you   say   of   the disadvantages   of   a   quickness   in   learning   is   extreamly true ,   but   that   is   not   the   worst   part ,   for   indeed   it makes   one   content   with   a   superficial   knowledge , &   away   one   runs   to   something   else ;   of   which   too   one acts   into   a   part   &   this   leads   to   error   which   is   worse much   of   Mr   Johnsons   work ,   &   detesting   all   the ribbaldry   with   which   he   has   been   treated .   I   think , he   has   not   in   his   criticisms   on   the   plays ,   pointed out   the   peculiar   excellencies   of   Shakespear   as   a Dramatick   poet ,   this   point   I   shall   labour   as   I   think he   therin   excells   every   one .   I   have   been   very   busy in   writing   upon   the   tragedy   of   Macbeth ,   which opens   a   large   field   for   criticism ,   as   I   have   there taken   notice   of   how   he   employs   his   supernatural   Beings ( who ,   ( by   the   by ,   other   poets   have   not   made   at   all supernatural .   I   have   compared   the   Manes   of   Darius with   the   Ghost   of   Hamlet ,   &   have ,   asking   yr   pardon , spoken   a   little   irreverently   of   the   Minerva   in   the Ajax   of   Sophocles .   How   larned   must   yr   friend   appear when   she   so   familiarly   criticises   Æschylus   &   Sophocles You   give   me   ardor   for   my   work   when   you   encourage me .   I   think   poor   Shakespear   is   like   an   unfortunate maid ,   whom   many   lovers   have   betrothed   &   none has   married .   The   subject   is   a   little   contaminated   still     I   wish   it   had   not   
BC_1766_EMONTAGU_EC_3	Denton   Oct   ye   It   is   impossible   for   my   dear   friend ,   in   her quiet   apartment ,   to   figure   to   herself ,   all   the   impertinent intrusions   of   business   &   bustle   here   .   The   morning meant   for   study   &   improvement ,   &   the   exercise   of the   intellectual   faculties ,   before   beef   and   pudding   their   powers ,   is   sometimes   usurped   by   visitors ;   oftener much ,   by   vulgar   cares ,   &   by   night   I   am   so   weary , I   am   obliged   to   seek   recreation   in   a   book .   My   little excursion   into   Yorkshire   last   week   was   very   pleasant , but   crouded   &   jumbled   so   much   business into   this   week ,   that   I   have   lived   in   a   perfect hurry .   I   wrote   to   our   friend   the   Sylph   the   very day   after   I   received   her   letter ,   &   shall   write   to   her again   in   a   post   or   two .   Alas   a   Coal   owner   is   but an   uncertain   correspondent .   I   do   not   know   what   to make   of   Mr   Johnsons   concessions   to   the   Mr   Revd Commentator   at   some   times ,   &   his   sneering   at   him at   others .   I   can   understand   it   only   thus ,   that the   said   Mr   Johnson   had   formerly   rashly &   inconsiderately   said ,   dans   le   gros   &   at   a rough   reckoning ,   that   ye   right   revd   was   a scholar ,   &   a   critick ,   &   a   man   of   parts ;   yet   whenever he   examines   him   by   articles ,   he   finds   that   in truth ,   his   Lordship   is   as   absurd   &   as   nonsensical as   possible ,   &   he   is   in   sad   dilemma   between   what he   has   said   formerly ,   &   what   he   wd   say   now . Thus   does   it   happen   to   those ,   who   profess   to   admire any   one   who   wants   common   sense ;   the   egregious blunders ;   the   glaring   errors ,   the   miserable   sophistric of   such   a   man ,   does   betray   to   shame ,   whoever rashly   told   the   world ,   they   had   been   captivated by   some   shewy   talent .   I   cannot   imagine   what these   wise   men   mean   by   denying   ye     part   of Henry   ye     to   be   Shakespears .   I   agree   with Mr   Johnson   as   to   ye   french   scene   in   ye   courtship , but   it   seems   to   me ,   he   has   very   superficially treated   of   ye   play   of   H:   ye   .   It   made   me   laugh heartily   to   read   a   parcel   of   litterati ,   some   of   them desiring   ye   reading   might   be   a   curs'd   others   a   scurs'd , others   a   crude ,   others   a   crush'd   neccesity ,   a   mighty pretty   amusement   truly   writing   such   notes .   Is   this the   infant   sporting   or   dotage   of   criticism ?   I   think ye   latter ,   there   is   an   imbecility   in   it   that   argues   parts worn   out .   There   is   another   pretty   note   enough ,   whether   ye   bees   shd   head   up   ye   honey ,   or   knead   up the   honey .   Criticks   make   no   honey ,   when   angry they   are   wasps ,   &   when   softer   they   are   drones . I   do   not   think   ye   curs'd   necessity   a   very   noble   phrase , it   is   brother   to   cursed   hard ,   &   cursed   foolish ,   & a   certain   rabble   of   phrases .   but   the   'scurs'd necessity   which   no   human   organ   can   utter ,   & ye   crush'd   necessity   which   no   human   brain can   conceive ,   or   the   crude   necessity   that   is not   form'd   for   want   of   ripeness   of   concoction seems   to   me   far   fetch'd   nonsense .   Shakespear deserved   some   praise   for   contriving   to   make his   Henry   so   naturally   arise   from   Prince   Hal . The   hint   thrown   out   of   his   having   studied mankind ,   &   their   various   occupations   &   duties in   the   promiscuous   company   he   had   kept ,   is artfull .   His   speech   to   ye   Conspirators   divine The   long   political   discussions   of   his   right   to   ye realm   of   France   is   undramatic ,   &   therefore   improper per on   the   stage .   His   reflections   at   his   return   from his   midnight   walk   round   the   camp   admirable . the   conversation   of   the   Soldiers   natural .   By   the by ,   I   think   Shakespear   has   therin   excelld   our darling   Tacitus ,   who   imagines   Germanicus   on   ye like   occasion   to   hear   nothing   but   his   own   praises . For   in   this ,   I   consider   Tacitus   as   a   rhetorican , who   is   not   more   veracious   by   trade   than   a Poet .   However   each   heightend   the   catastrophe , for   ye   preceding   gloom   shews   to   greater   advantage ye   glory   of   Henrys   victory ,   and   Germanicus's   prosperity makes   his   death   more   sad   &   lamentable .   However , in   hast   I   have   thrown   these   things   into   an   odd hotch   potch .   I   shall   not   write   any   thing   on   ye play   of   H:   ye   .   Considered   as   a   Drama   or as   showing   ye   poetical   talents ,   it   is   not   so well   worth   attention   as   many   other   plays . but   I   think   it   wd   afford   more   critical   observations than   our   Commentators   have   bestowd upon   it .   Adieu   my   dear   friend .   I   rejoyce   that   you walk   &   gently . I   am   every   yrs   most   truly   E M 
BC_1766_EMONTAGU_EC_4	Oct:   ye     My   dear   Friend , I   am   quite   of   your   opinion ,   that our   last   Commentator   of   Shakespear   found   the piddling   trade   of   verbal   criticism   below   his   genius and   I   am   much   at   a   loss ,   when   I   would   account for   his   persisting   in   it ,   through   ye   course   of   so   many volumes .   It   has   been   lucky   for   my   amusement ,   but unfortunate   for   the   publick ,   that   he   did   not   consider his   Author   in   a   more   extensive   view .   I   have   so   much veneration   for   our   Poet ,   &   so   much   zeal   for   the   honour of   our   Country ,   &   I   think   the   Theatrical   entertainments capable   of   conveying   so   much   instruction   to ,   &   of   exciting such   sentiments   in   the   people ,   that   if   I   am   glad he   left   the   task   to   my   unable   hand ,   I   dare   hardly own   it   to   myself .   Our   rank   in   the   Belles   lettres depends   a   good   deal   on   that   degree   of   merit which   is   allow'd   to   Shakespear ,   who   is   more   than any   other   writer   read   by   foreigners .   This   consideration might   excite   the   zeal   of   his   Country   man ,   but there   remains   yet   another ,   which   is   common   to   the whole   World .   The   dramatick   art   is   ill   understood . A   cold   dry   logician   is   address'd   to ,   is   invok'd ,   as the   Muse   of   Tragedy ,   from   a   few   barren   precepts   the Poets   are   to   produce   the   various ,   the   strong ,   the   affecting characters   of   dramatick   poetry .   I   will   allow   yr   friend Aristotle   speaks   like   a   man   of   Sense   upon   the   Drama , but   one   might   as   well   compose   an   Oration   from half   a   dozen   monosyllables   as   make   a   tragedy from   his   rules .   Now   &   then ,   a   learned   man ,   who   has read   the   Greek   tragedians ,   takes   it   into   his   head   to   give us   a   Greek   Tragedy   in   English ,   &   Medea   brews   a   la   greque &   calls   on   all   the   infernal   powers   to   assist   her   and &   help   her   to   gather   a   parcel   of   simples ,   which   in her   Country   were   reckon d   very   potent   in   charms , but   by   the   English   Spectator   are   not   esteem'd   of such   virtue   as   sage ,   rue ,   &   dandelion .   Another Poet   brings   you   a   Roman   stoick   cold   &   hard . Corneille   having   heard   the   Romans   were   the   first people   in   the   World ,   makes   every   individual   Roman speak   as   if   he   was   Rome ;   &   his   great   business is   to   bully   Kings ,   these   Kings   wd   all   fall   at   a   Consuls feet ,   if   some   Virago   with   whom   his   Majesty   is in   love   did   not   tell   him   she   wd   not   give   her hand   to   the   slave   of   Rome ,   and   all   this   stuff   is   to pass   if   there   be   nothing   against   the   rules   of   Aristotle . Nature   may   be   misrepresented ,   customs   neglected , character   violated ,   still   ye   work   is   not   counterd   and   it has   Aristotles   permitt .   It   is   strange   that   Mr   Johnson should   so   superficially   examine   the   merits   and   faults of   his   Authors   plays :   he   should   have   said   more or   have   said   nothing .   If   he   had   given   attention to   the   dramatick   genius   of   Shakespear   he   might have   done   him   justice ,   &   I   wonder   he   did   not   enter with   pleasure   into   a   task   that   seem'd   peculiarly suited   to   him ,   he   has   taste   &   learning ,   therefore is   a   capable   critick ;   he   wants   invention ,   he   wants strength   &   vigour   of   genius   to   go   through   a   long original   work .   I   will   own   he   gives   smart   correction to   former   Commentators ,   but   ye   last   Commentator deserves   the   least   indulgence ,   as   he   had   most opportunity   of   seeing   the   futility   of   the   thing . I   am   entirely   of   yr   opinion ,   &   surely   it   cannot   all be   disputed ,   that   Proteus   means   as   yet   he   knows only   the   face   of   his   mistress ,   to   her   other   more commanding   perfections   he   is   still   a   stranger . Do   you   agree   with   Mr   Johnson   &   Pope   that   ye   style   of   the   Gentlemen   of   Verona   is   less   affected   than   almost any   play   of   Shakespears ?   Johnson   adds ,   it   has   as   many fine   lines   &   passages   as   any   of   his .   Where   are   they ? It   is   a   little   unlucky   that   ye   note   remarking   ye pure   &   unaffecting   style   of   this   play   should   be placed   under   ye   following   words , Wer't   not ,   affection   chains   thy   tender   days to   the   sweet   glances   of   thy   honour d   love   & c Affection   chaining   tender   days   to   sweet   glances of   an   honourd   love   is   surely   a   very   easy   natural mode   of   expression !   I   am   not   yet   able   to   fix   the time   when   I   shall   go   to   London ,   having   still   so   much business   to   do .   I   will   endeavour   to   get   Dr   Greys   artificial memory   for   my   young   folks   but   I   imagine   they   are yet   too   young   &   unlearned   for   it . 
BC_1766_EMONTAGU_EV_1	Febry   ye     Tho   truths   &   trueisms   are   out   of fashion ,   yet   I   will   certainly   tell   my   dear   Mrs   Vesey that   I   love   her   as   the   most   pleasant ,   &   esteem   her as   the   most   valuable   of   friends ,   so   I   can   easily   that part   of   her   letter ,   but   for   the   political   queries   I am   afraid   I   shall   not   be   able   to   do   so   well ;   however at   Mr   Veseys   commands ,   who   I   see   understands perfectly   my   way   of   treating   my   lovers ,   which is   to   give   them   nothing   but   fair   words   &   syllables civily   arranged ,   I   will   try   what   I   can   do .   In   the first   place   I   invoke   the   spirits   of   Gazetteers ,   Brittish journals ,   &   all   the   mighty   muses   of   Grubstreet   to   assist me .   Before   the   meeting   of   parliament   news   came   of terrible   hurley   burleys   in   America ,   Our   young   Ministers , qui   ne   s'etoient   jamais   trouvé   a   telle   fête ,   were   allarmd , they   were   sensible   they   were   too   young   to   manage things   so   difficult ,   our   Major   Ministers   apprehended they   were   too   old   to   contend   with   matters   so   violent . Some   took   hartshorn ,   some   assafetida ,   but   none   took the   grand   specific   in   such   maladies   a   firm   resolution   . The   Parliament   met ,   you   know   the   Kings   speech , which   was   not   decisive   but   prudently   equivoque , &   they   were   to   meet   again .   In   the   House   of   Lords Lord   Temple   &   Lord   Lyttelton   spoke   nobly   of   the Authority   of   Parliament ;   &   the   dignity   of   Government . Then   they   all   went   into   the   Country   to   eat their   Christmass   pies ,   some   for   the   sake   of   present care   could   have   swallow'd   with   them   the affronts   from   America ,   others   were   high   stomached &   could   not   digest   them .   Hollidays   past ,   then came   working   days   indeed .   The   Kings   speech was   firm ,   it   pleased   the   hearts   of   oak   &   they praised   it ,   &   thank'd   his   Majesty   for   it ,   &   express'd a   desire   to   support   the   authority   of   Government . A   day   was   named   for   taking   this   great   affair into   consideration ,   on   that   day   Mr   Pitt   came up   from   Bath ,   He   talk'd   of   liberty ,   of   natural liberty ,   &   he   loved   liberty   &   liberty   loved   him   &   I know   not   what ,   &   people   said   that   part   of   his speech   was   great   but   they   did   not   well   understand it .   Mr   Grenville   talk'd   of   laws ,   &   quoted the   Statutes   in   support   of   the   legality   of   ye   stamp act ,   Mr   Pitt   bid   him   not   tell   him   of   doggseared , doubled   down   acts   of   Parliament ,   he   was   for natural   liberty ,   and   he   was   for   repeating   the stamp   act   it   appeared .   This   did   not   please ,   but his   next   appearance   in   the   House   was   more violent ,   he   said   we   had   broken   the   compact between   England   &   America , &   they   were   Independant or   some   thing   of   that   sort ,   he   raild   at Ministers   past   &   present ,   &   was   violent   against the   D:   of   Newcastle .   This   last   speech   has   totally ruined   him   in   the   City ,   he   has   lost   his   popularity here ,   but   will   find   it   rise   as   the   Sun   does   with the   Antipodes   as when   it   sets   in   this   Hemisphere . It   is   amazing   how   the   Tyde   has   turn'd .   The   last   time he   spoke   in   the   House   there   was   violent   opposition to   him   no   applause   of   what   he   said ,   &   when   Sr   F N-   said   that   in   other   times   who   ever   had   spoken such   a   language   would   have   been   sent   to   the Tower ,   no   one   resented   it .   He   had   with   him entirely ,   only   Mr   Barré   &   Mr   Huske .   Mr   G   Townshend has   as   yet   been   perfectly   silent .   Mr   Burke   spoke extreamly   well .   The   Ministers   in   the   House   of   Commons were   not   at   Unison   with   those   in   the   House of   Lords ,   they   want   some   body   to   lead   the   Chorus . It   is   supposed   this   Ministry   will   not   last   long , but   who   the   next   will   be   compond   of   I   know not .   We   do   not   look   on   Ireland   as   a   Sister   to America ,   but   to   England ,   America   is   our Child   &   a   very   perverse   one . Our   friend   Mrs   Carter   is   gay ,   coquette   &   dissipated as   she   used   to   be ,   always   at   ye   toillette   the   whole morning ,   &   in   assemblies   in   the   evening ,   however she   finds   time   to   regret   your   absence ,   so   you   may   pass over   her   other   immoralities   with   a   slight   censure .   She   is   very well   sits   by   me   at   this   moment   &   desires   her   love .   She   dined yesterday   at   Mrs   John   Pitts   where   she   had   the   pleasure of   meeting   Mrs   Dunbar .   Lady   Primrose   I   hear   has found   benefit   by   the   Bath   waters .   Mrs   Howe is   just   come   to   her   new   house .   I   saw   Ld   Palmerston at   Almacks .   I   should   have   written   to   my   dear Mrs   Vesey   before   I   had   her   letter   but   I   was   engaged to   a   cold   &   fever     weeks ,   &   Mr   Montagu   has   been ill   of   a   cold ;   these   things   have   taken   up   my   time &   incapacited   me   for   writing . The   press   has   not   produced   any   thing   very   good this   year   of   any   size .   The   Witts   appear   in   duodecimo or   the   robe   de   Chambre   of   a   blue   pamplet ,   but I   will   send   you   a   pretty   short   work   of   a   scotch physicians .   Rousseau   is   at   Chiswick ,   he   left London   because   he   wd   not   be   gazed   at . I   am   sorry   Mr   Jeptison   is   going   into   a   state   for which   duller   mortals   are   quite   as   fit . Lord   Lyttelton   has   made   many   admirable   speeches in   the   house   of   Lords .   He   is   in   his   usual   delicate state   of   health .   Lady   Shelburne   seems   very   happy and   her   Son   is   a   charming   boy .   Ld   Shelburne   spoke very   well   on   the   American   affair . When   there   is   any   thing   like   a   decision   of   this Stamp   affair   I   will   give   you   the   best   account I   can .   The   House   of   Lords   will   sit   on   Monday the   Commons   on   tuesday . I   beg   my   compts   to   Mr   Vesey   with   congratulations on   his   election   but   I   had   rather   he   had   been chosen   for   Westminster .   He   will   think   I   have   sent him   strange   skimble   skamble   stuff   by   way of   news   but   it   is   so   we   talk   in   London ,   my   best compts   attend   Mrs   Handcock . I   am   my   Dear   Madam your   most   affectionate Most   Obliged   &   c E Montagu 
BC_1766_EMONTAGU_EV_2	feb   ye     My   dear   Madam To   gather   news   one   should   go   out , to   write   letters   one   should   stay   at   home .   To   reconcile these   things   is   not   so   easy .   I   have   given   so   many hours   to   collecting   my   news   I   have   little   time   to write   it .   Yesterday   the   House   of   Lords   met ,   ye   grand question   as   enclosed ,   the   speakers   as   you   see .   Ld Campden   &   Lord   Mansfield   spoke   admirably .   All people   admired   the   parts   of   each   speaker ,   the arguments   of   the   latter   had   greater   prosperity . In   the   House   of   Commons   there   was   a   division on   ye   same   question ,   Mr   Pitt ,   Mr   Beckford ,   &   Col Barré   made   ye   whole   minority ,   so   you   see the   Gods   &   Cato   are   again   on   different   sides . Lord   Lyttelton   spoke   yesterday   better   than   ever Lord   Shelburn   spoke   well .   To   day   there   was   a   debate in   the   House   of   Lord   on   this ,   that   the   King shd   require   the   Governors   to   desire   the   assemblies to   get   ye   people   who   had   sufferd   in   their   houses so   by   the   mobs   about   ye   stamps   to   have amends   made   them   for   the   damage   sustaind . Ld   Campden   made   objection   to   ye   word   require , &   wishd   it   to   be   changed   to   recommend ,   but on   Ld   Mansfields   explaining   that   it   was   ye assemblies   who   were   to   require   the   money to   be   raised   Ld   Campden   assented .   To   ye   surprize of   all   people   the   D:   of   Grafton   &   Ld   Dartmouth desired   ye   word   might   be   recommend .   The   question was   put   &   the   Ministers   lost   it   by   three .   What induced   them   to   desire   the   honour   of   losing   a question   I   do   not   know .   Mr   Montagu   not   being well   enough   to   attend   ye   house   of   Commons I   can   give   little   account   what   pass d   there , but   ye   house   sat   till     in   ye   morning   ,   on   some question   ye   Minority   rose   from     persons   to twenty   five   persons .   Considering   the   House   was full ,     was   as   small   number .   Never   was   ye House   more   unanimous .   I   am   sure   you   will   be glad   of   ye   fame   Ld   Lyttelton   has   acquired   tho   he   is   for   ye stamps   which   I   believe   is   not   the   popular side   in   Ireland .   The   King   has   had   a   cold   but is   better .   I   was   at   the   Dss   of   Ancailers   last   night where   ye   Peers   came   in   late   but   none   of ye   Commons .   My   account   is   confused   but   it   is   all I   could   gather .   Ld   Moreton   made   a   marvellous   speech more   to   ye   amusement   than   edification   of   ye   House Ld   Chancellor   a   ludicrous   one .   If   I   could   have seen   Ld   Lyttelton   I   should   have   had   more   distinct information   but   you   might   as   well   expect a   swallows   nest   in   yr   chimney   as   a   Politician in   yr   chimney   corner   in   these   times .   I   design for   the   future   to   addict   myself   intirely   to   the Blue   Stocking   philosophy   which   treads   not the   paths   of   ambition .

BC_1766_EMONTAGU_EV_3	Dear   Madm Beautifull   are   the   feet   of   those   who bring   glad   tydings   from   the   Mountains ,   and beautifull   therefore   shd   appear   my   scrawl informing   you   the   stamp   act   was   repeald by   a   majority   of   one   hund: d   &   eight   &   our   friend   Mr Burke   spoke   divinely ,   yes   divinely ,   dont misunderstand   me ,   &   report   he   spoke   as well   as   mortal   man   could   do ,   I   tell   you he   spoke   better .   The   great   Commoner praised   him   highly   in   the   Senate ,   & all   people   join   in   the   chorus ,   the   banks of   ye   Thames   resound   with   his   praise , it   roars   in   the   great   streets   &   it   is   whisperd even   in   Courts   &   alleys .   Indeed   Mr   Burke has   every   day   acquired   great   praise but   yesterday   crown'd   all .   Mr   Pitt   did   not speak   so   well   as   he   has   done .   He   described   the   American   planter   sitting   in   his   native innocence   in   his   native   woods ,   &   how   cruel   to disturb   Him   there   with   a   stamp   duty ,   but   as this   duty   was   not   to   be   levied   on   men   who   under the   shade   of   melancholly   boughs lose   &   neglect   the   creeping   hours   of   time ,   but affects   ye   litigious   man   who   goes   to   law ,   or the   mercantile   man   who   sends   commodities out   to   Sea ,   the   pastoral   part   of   the   speech , though   adornd   with   quotations   from   the Georgies ,   did   not   greatly   move   the   House . In   the   House   of   Lords   there   will   be   more opposition   to   the   Ministry ,   but   still   ye   act will   be   repealed .   I   expect   Lady   Shelburne every   moment   so   must   be   laconick .   Ld Lyttelton   desires   Ld   Orrerys   wretched   letters on   ye   English   history   may   not   be   attributed to   him   neither   as   to   ye   matter   or   ye manner .   I   enclose   a   letter   Mr   Walpole   wrote to   Rousseau   in   ye   name   of   ye   K   of   Prussia I   have   taken   ye   liberty   to   enclose     proposals for   my   friend   Mr   Woodhouse .   As   you   love   virtue &   verse   I   am   sure   you   will   be   glad   to dispose   of   them   for   him ,   &   it   be   of   great service   to   him   to   be   introduced   into   Ireland under   yr   patronage .   The   birthday   was most   brilliant .   I   have   not   yet   recoverd the   fatigue   of   it .   Enter   the   Bishop   of   Bristol &   so   Adieu   ! yrs E M Mrs   Carter   is   well 
BC_1766_EMONTAGU_EV_4	Sept   ye     Denton   near   Newcastle upon   Tyne Last   night   brought   me   the   kind ,   the   friendly favour   of   my   dear   Mrs   Veseys   letter .   I   had   before   said to   my   self ,   you   would   deeply   regret   Sr   James   Macdonald , &   would   sensibly   feel   for   me .   The   sad   state   of   health he   was   in   last   winter ,   &   the   bad   accounts   I   had   received just   before   the   fatal   event ,   prepared   me   for   the   blow , as   much   as   one   can   be   prepared   for   such   a   misfortune . You   knew   what   he   was ,   you   could   form   expectations of   what   he   would   be ,   so   I   shall   say   the   less   of   his qualities   in   general ,   but   there   were   some   beautifull strokes ,   some   fine   finishings   in   his   character   which no   one   could   see   who   was   not   any   intimate   with him .   I   had   so   interested   my   self   for   his   success   in the   World ,   &   proposed   to   my   self   such   a   pleasure in   seeing   him   one   of   the   first   men   in   his   Country that   this   event   has   blown   down   many   Castles   in the   air .   I   knew   his   good   heart   too   well   to   think that   he   would   ever   forget   how   sincerely   I   was   his   friend . &   that   even   in   the   persuits   of   ambition   he   wd   disdain to   come   &   pass   an   evening   sometimes   with   me ,   when age   &   infirmities   might   confine   me   to   my   fireside . This   incomparable   young   man   was   the   object   of my   ambition .   I   had   a   maternal   pride   in   him , &   sollicitude   for   him .   the   difference   of   our   ages made   a   facility   in   our   intimacy ;   his   talent   of   accommodating himself   to   all   kinds   of   persons   made him   a   treasure   in   my   social   system ,   but   I   am ashamed   to   dwell   in   my   own   misfortune ,   while Lady   Margaret   Macdonald   has   a   right   to   all   my pity   I   wrote   to   a   Servant   in   Hillstreet   to   inquire after   her ,   &   I   hear   she   is   better   than   she   was . What   a   loss   too   has   ye   Isle   of   Skey !   where   he   was introducing   arts   &   industry ,   &   establishing   manufactures &   improving   agriculture ,   civilizing   manners , &   like   a   benignant   Sun ,   dispelling   darkness , &   cherishing   all   that   makes   life   chearfull   & happy .   When   one   thinks   of   these   things ,   one   is apt   to   murmur   &   to   say why   should   a   dog ,   a   horse ,   a   rat ,   have   life , and   thou   no   breath   at   all ? But   infinite   wisdom   knows   best ,   &   his   will   be   done . At   my   first   coming   into   Northumberland   I   had not   good   health ,   &   having   much   business   I   had delay d   writing   to   my   dear   friend ,   but   a   thousand times   a   day   I   thought   of   her .   About   ye   first   of august   I   set   out   for   Scotland ,   &   staid   there   a   month I   intended   writing   to   you   at   my   return ,   &   shd   have done   it   directly ,   but   this   sad   subject ,   in   which I   knew   you   interested ,   damp d   my   spirits ;   however I   had   got   a   cover   franked   on   purpose . I   shall write   to   you   again   in   a   few   posts ,   &   give   you an   account   of   what   I   saw   in   Scotland .   I   often wishd   for   you   among   Mountains   &   rocks . My   spirit   carried   me   into   ye   Highlands ,   Dr Gregory ,   ye   author   of   ye   comparative   View   of the   state   &   faculties   of   man   with   those   of   the animal   World   ,   was   so   good   as   to   accompany me ,   his   book   will   have   inform d   you   he   is   very ingenious ,   but   he   is   tender   being   a   man   of great   learning   &   genius   the   most   gentle   &   amiable imaginable   with   fine   taste   &   an   elegant   stile   of   manners . We   carried   Ossian   in   the   Chaise   &   read   stories in   the   very   places   where   they   happend .   I   talkd to   the   Doctor   of   you ,   &   I   assure   you   you   was   toasted at   Edinburgh .   Mr   Keith ,   unluckily   for   me ,   was gone   to   London   to   see   Monsr   &   Mdme   de   Harrock . I   saw   his   daughters   who   are   very   agreable . I   was   much   pleased   with   Scotland .   the   prospects are   beautifull   in   some   parts ,   sublime   in   others . The   Scotch   are   vastly   obliging   to   strangers ,   they   are indeed   a   very   well   bred   people ,   &   I   found   every where   a   most   polite   hospitality .   There   is   not   to be   found   amongst   them   ignorance   or   brutality , no   Squires   property   so   call d .   At   Dr   Gregorys   we had   Dr   Robertson ,   or   Dr   Blair ,   or   some   distinguishd person   every   evening .   They   live   in   ye   french way ,   des   petits   soupers   faire   ,   &   they   have   ye easy   address   of   ye   the   french .   The   letterd   Sage &   rural   Gentleman   is   in   Scotland   a   polite   man . I   have   got   two   little   girls   of   Dr   Gregorys   with   me here ,   they   are   lovely   children   ye   eldest     years old .   I   am   endeavouring   to   mitigate   their   scotch   accents in   every   thing   else   they   are   what   one   could wish .   I   have   indeed   some   verse   made   by   Sr Gilbert   Elliot   on   the   death   of   Ld   &   Lady   Sutherland you   may   shew   them   to   whom   you   please   but do   not   give   a   copy .   I   wish   you   had   seen   the   Chapel at   Holyrood   House   where   they   are   buried   imagine a   great   Gothick   chappel   very   gloomy   originaly . made   horrid   by   onerous   decay ,   &   more   by   the mummies   of   many   of   their   departed   Kings the   mountain   that   hangs   over   this   building &   the   other   circumstances   make   it   of   the   terrible   sublime . I   saw   death   triumphing   over   beauty   in   the face   of   Lord   Darnely   Marys   murderd   husband . His   Catastrophe   added   horrors   to   the   King of   terrors ,   imagination   was   more   shocked   than ye   eye   for   he   looks   only   ye   faded   image   of a   handsome   man .   Why   dont   you   tell   me   when you   shall   come   to   England .   Alas   what   losses   has our   Cotterie   sustain d !   youth   in   its   finest   lustre , age   in   its   mildest   graces ,   a   few   more   such   strokes &   like   yr   Malvina   we   shall   depart   weary   of conversing   with   ye   souls   of   little   men .

BC_1766_EMONTAGU_EV_5	Denton   ye     of   Oct   A   journey   I   made   to   an   estate   of   Mr Montagu's   &   a   multiplicity   of   affairs   here   delay d   my intended   letter   to   my   dear   Mrs   Vesey .   As   the   Season approaches ,   in   which   the   City   of   London   should ,   under her   sable   wing   of   sea   coal   smoak ,   gather   together   those who   have   been   wandering   &   fluttering   through various   Regions   during   summer   days ,   let   me   begin by   enquiring   when   you   will   come   to   your   nest   in Bolton   row .   This   is   a   question   of   such   importance   to   me , that did   the   Delphian   Oracle ,   as   of   old ,   give   answers to   mighty   queries ,   I   would   instantly   sail   to   Greece for   satisfaction ;   but   as   Priests   &   Priestesses   are   silent , tell   me ,   &   tell   me   quickly ,   &   without   Oracular ambiguity .   I   think   I   promised   to   send   you   an account   of   my   tour   into   Scotland .   I   am   not   sure whether   I   did   not   describe   in   my   last   the   Palace of   Holyrood   &   Castle   of   Edinburgh ,   so   I   shall   not   say any   thing   of   them   for   what's   so   tedious   as   a   twice   told   tale . We   will   therefore   leave   Edinburgh   &   go   to   Glasgow , a   great   trading   Town ,   built   with   fine   stone ,   the houses   large ,   the   streets   wide ,   &   all   built   at   right angles :   the   polices   such   that   the   Shambles   &   all   daily business   is   carried   on   in   distant   quarters   of   the Town .   Never   did   I   see   a   place   of   Commerce   &   manufactures that   had   so   little   of   the   mechanical   air . The   Sciences   have   a   University ,   &   the   arts   an Academy   here .   I   was   kindly   entertaind   at   the   house of   Lord   Provost   Cochran ,   a   little   way   out   of   the   Town . I   went   to   see   Hamilton   where   there   is   a   fine   collection of   pictures .   I   pass'd   by   the   Castle   of   the   aspiring Earl   Bothwell ,   it   remains   a   sad   monument   of wicked   ambition .   Here   he   sigh'd   for   Mary ,   &   here   his unfortunate   wife   wept   his   inconstancy .   I   was   now got   on   Classick   ground   on   the   banks   of   the   Clyde ,   and I   thought   of   the   days   of   other   times .   I   stay'd   a   day at   Lord   Provosts ,   &   then   set   out   for   Inverary .   Now Madam ,   your   imagination   must   put   on   ses   bottes de   sept   lieues   &   follow   me ,   over   the   hills   &   far away   In   My   first   stage   I   pass'd   by   the   Castle   of Dumbarton   which   stands   on   a   high   rock .   I   dined at   a   village   &   forayd   over   a   little   river ,   &   soon got   to   the   banks   of   lough   loman ,   a   vast   Lake   of liquid   crystal ,   which   is   bound   in   by   a   bed   of alabaster   pebbles .   This   lake   is   in   some   places   eight miles   broad ,   has   in   it   many   beautifull   Islands ,   in some   there   are   deer   feeding ,   others   rising   in   a   pyramidical form   have   firr   trees   growing   to   the   very top ,   rocks   &   hills   form   a   bold   shore   in   the   opposite side ,   &   the   vast   Ben   loman   lifts   his   proud   head to   the   clouds .   the   Military   road   carried   us   many miles   by   the   side   of   this   delightfull   Lake   to   the pretty   Village   of   Luss .   As   the   Sun   was   only   setting I   took   a   walk   there ,   &   picked   up   for   my   guide ,   a pretty   Nymph ,   no   Cicerone   she ,   nor   had   she   the decay d   monuments   of   pride   to   display   to   us ,   but   with much   rural   innocence   &   gentleness   of   manners , she   shew'd   us   the   humble   beauties   of   her   native Village .   The   softness   of   the   evening   air ,   the   murmur of   the   stream ,   the   dying   gales   panting   on   the   trees , and   the   parting   beams   of   the   sun ,   which   seem d   both , like   other   bright   beauties ,   to   quit   the   lookinglass ,   and still   play'd   upon   the   stream ,   much   reconciled   me   to pastoral   life .   You   know   nothing   is   so   pretty   in   imagination . I   had   put   on   my   russet   robes ,   adorn'd   my   crook   with flowers ,   &   was   looking   for   a   Swain ,   but   alas   after   Dames   there   one   seeks   in   vain !   however   before   I   had time   to   vex   at   that   circumstance   I   was   awaken d   from   my   reverie by   the   noise   of   wheels .   I   ask'd   what   manufactory was   carried   on   in   the   place ;   my   guide   smiled ,   & said   the   Ministers   three   daughters   were   spinning :   in   the state   my   mind   was   in ,   less   did   I   envy   the   immortal nymphs ,   who   turn   the   adamantine   spindle   round , &   spin   the   fates   of   men   &   empires ,   than   these   village spinsters .   May   never   mildew   spoil   their   web !   Why   sleeps the   sweet   voice   of   Cona   who   should   celebrate   their charms   &   praise   their   labours ?   When   it   grew   dark I   retired   to   my   Inn ,   &   we   concluded   the   evening with   reading   Ossians   poems   in   his   own   favorite land .   Early   in   the   morning   we   began   to   ascend   the the   Mountains ;   the   lake   lay   glittering   below ,   in   one spot   we   saw   the   Lake   winding   for   five   &   twenty   miles . &   just   in   this   spot   we   parted   with   it ,   &   enterd   upon another   scene .   The   road   now   lay   through   vast   mountains which   rose   one   above   an   other   in   astonishing   and tremendous   greatness ,   on   their   sides   hung   shaggy goats ,   browzing   as   high   as   the   eye   could   reach ,   below them   sheep   were   feeding ;   here   &   there ,   the   hand   of industry   had   reach'd   to   a   considerable   height   to plant   corn   where   the   broad   footed   ox   could   not   plow . but   most   parts   of   the   mountains   are   coverd   with a   dark   moss ,   which   adds   much   to   the   solemnity of   their   appearance ,   down   their   wrinkled   cheeks , which   are   furrow'd   by   the   torrents   of   some   thousand winters   collected   rain   &   snow ,   in   summer   softly trickles   many   streams   which   unite   to   form a   river   at   the   bottom .   Some   of   the   steeper   mountains are   by   the   floods   left   bare   of   soil ,   &   exhibit   there rocky   skeletons ,   &   look   hideously   great .   In   the vale   of   Clencrow ,   once   the   delight   of   Ossian   I stopp'd   to   dine .   by   the   side   of   the   roaring   stream   of   Cona in   a   deep   vale   with   mountains   almost   meeting above   me ,   no   ossian   appeard   from   thence ,   but   a   road still   winding   along   ye   feet   of   the   mountains .   I did   not   chuse desire   to   leave   this   magnificent   scene of   nature   to   enter   the   smoaky   cottage   from   whence I   had   the   trout   just   caught   from   the   stream broild   on   the   coals ,   &   excellent   herrings .   I   was now   living   in   epick ,   &   I   rememberd   Homer's Heroes   always   eat   their   meal   broild   on   the   coals . Perhaps   even   Helens   cook   had   not   a   gridiron   any more   than   my   hostess   at   Glencrow .   While   I   dined , the   Eagles   soared   above   our   heads ,   for   all   was great   in   this   astonishing   scene .   the   murmur of   the   stream   of   Cona   brought   to   imaginations ear   the   notes   of   ossians   harp .   &   I   saw   Malvina   weeping in   the   mist   of   the   cloudcapt   mountain .   At   my departure   I   bade   my   Landlady   wish   me   a   good journey   in   erse   which   she   did   with   great   politeness .   The rest   of   the   day   we   still   ascended   from   mountain   to Mountain ,   about   five   in   the   afternoon   we   arrived at   Inverary :   here   the   lake   of   Lough   fine   opend at   once   upon   us .   To   give   you   some   idea   of   it , I   must   tell   you ,   the   great   Leviathan   had   taken his   pastime   there   in   the   night   before .   This   Lough is     miles   from   the   Ocean ,   but   the   whales   often visit   it   during   the   herring   season .   I   stay'd   part of   the   next   day   at   Inverary   &   visited   the   Duke of   Argylles   Castle   &   his   grounds ,   which   are   laid out   for   pleasure ,   such   are   call'd   policies   in   Scotland . The   building   have   cost   a   great   deal ,   but   the   architect did   not   avail   himself   of   the   Gothick   licence in   Architecture ,   but   has   made   a   Castle   as   compact as   a   chest   of   drawers .   Indeed ,   the   lake   before   it , &   a   Mountain   coverd   with   Old   firr   &   bech   trees to   its   sharp   summit ,   wd   have   made   any   work of   art   appear   little ,   but   this   alas   is   perfectly diminutive   compared   to   the   adjacent   objects . There   was   an   Erse   sermon   preach d   at   Inverary the   day   I   spent   there ,   I   shd   have   gone   to   Church if   Ossian   wd   have   sang   the   Anthem   but   my   time being   short   &   not   expecting   to   be   much   edified by   the   sermon   I   contented   my   self   with   hearing Erse   talk d   round   me   in   the   Town .   I   return d   to Glasgow   the   same   way   I   came ,   not   having   time to   take   a   larger   tour   in   going   back   the   objects diminishd   as   they   had   increased   before .   but   this was   in   some   measure   compensated   by   another   beauty which   the   scene   acquired   from   the   days   being   foggy . Every   mountain   was   crown'd   with   mist   on   which the   Sun   beams   in   some   form'd   a   bright   diadem , in   others   there   was   an   appearance   of   blue   smoak as   if   some   of   the   thinner   &   more   craggy   mountains were   dissolving   into   air ,   into   thin   air ,   &   would   shortly like   the   baseless   fabric   of   a   vision   wd   dissolve and   leave   not   a   rock   behind .   I   have   now   Madam   brought you   on   the   road   back   to   Glasgow   you   may   there visit   with   me   the   University   the   Academy   & the   Printing   Office ,   &   talk   with   all   the   professors   & artists   but   I   am   sure   you   are   too   much   tired   to   go with   me   to   Stirling   Blair   Drummond   &   c .   If   you   are not   quite   overcome   with   this   rough   Campaign   I   may   carry you   into   softer   scenes ,   but   at   present   I   will   leave   you   to   repose   yrself 
BC_1766_EMONTAGU_EV_6	Denton   nov:   ye     And   so   my   dear   Mrs   Vesey   while   you   are reposing   yourself   in   yr   drawing   room   sur   votre   chaise longue   ;   or   indolently   lolling   in   Malvinas   cave   listening to   the   sighing   gales ,   you   think   I   must   travel   par   monts &   par   vaux   ,   fly   after   ye   Eagle ,   or   angle   for   a   Whale , on   purpose   to   set   your   imagination   a   slaving .   And   the   worst is   when   I   have   told   you   every   thing ,   you   wont   believe about   half   of   it .   I   dare   say   you   have   not   digested   the Whole ,   &   you   have   certainly   told   miss   Hancock   that   my Eagles   were   nothing   but   Sparrow   hawks .   you   must   know Madam ,   that   the   great   traveller   Dr   Pocock   when   he was   at   Glencrow ,   took   it   into   his   head   to   go   a   birds nesting ,   not   for   sparrows   as   boys   do ,   but   to   seek   the   callow Eagles .   From   the   Ayerie   the   good   Bishop   had   as   good   an opportunity   of   preaching   to   the   birds   as   St   Simon from   the   Sea   shore   to   the   fishes ,   but   I   did   not   hear that   he   sermonized   to   the   fowls   that   wing   the midway   air ,   so   that   I   imagine   he   mounted   from   the inclination   a   Bishop   naturally   has   to   be   near   a   translation however ,   there   was   not   a   fiery   chariot   ready   to carry   him   off ,   so   he   return'd   to   his   terrestial   situation My   curiosity   will   never   pry   into   such   a   formidable recess   as   the   Eagles   nest ,   for   should   the   Lady   of   the house   come   home ,   &   find   one   there ,   she   might not   give   one   very   hospitable   entertainment .   I   am told   the   Bishop   found   good   provisions ,   fine   quarters of   Lamb ,   many   more   fowl   & c ,   but   nothing   roasted , nor   any   invitation   to   dinner .   I   went   from   the   Highlands back   to   the   Ld   Provosts   at   Glasgow ,   pass'd a   day   there ,   visited   the   University   &   the   Academy for   Painting .   To   find   the   sciences   &   beaux   arts making   part   of   the   police   of   a   place   of   trade &   manufactures   gave   me   great   pleasure .   The   Mercantile Towns   in   England   seem   dedicated   to   Mammon a   filthy   Deity   who   keeps   pernicious   fasts   or   gives at   times   swinish   &   gluttonous   feasts .   Here   the   Muses will   mitigate   avarice   or   sanctify   wealth .   I went   to   see   Hamilton   where   there   is   a   fine   of   pictures .   I   pass'd   by   the   ruins   of   Earl   Bothwells Castle ,   there   fox   looks   out   from   the   windows   &   the ruins   remain   a   sad   Monument   of   the   vengeance of   Heaven .   From   Glasgow   I   went   to   Blair   Drummond the   Seat   of   Ld   Kames   the   Author   of   the   elements of   Criticism .   You   cannot   imagine   any   thing more   delightfull   than   to   walk   by   the   side   of a   rapid   River   where   there   are   many   natural Cascades   &   beautifull   rocks ,   on   the   right   hand ; on   the   left ,   a   deep   wood ,   in   view   the   ruined   Castle of   the   Regent   Murray ,   whose   rigours   to   poor Mary   Stewart   his   Sister   &   Sovereign ,   &   his   virtues as   unamiable   as   the   very   vices   of   gentler   minds , made   me   consider   his   Catastrophe   &   the   ruin of   his   proud   dwelling   with   an   unpitying   heart . I   was   very   politely   entertain'd   at   Blair   Drummond , &   at   my   departure   Ld   Kames   attended me   to   Stirling   Castle ,   which   is   situated   on   a high   rock ,   it   commands   a   fine   prospect ,   but the   River   scene   is   a   line   more   crooked   than the   line   of   beauty ,   so   that   it   seems   to   form   various pools ,   &   is   less   beautifull   than   ye   gentle   serpentine In   our   way   from   Stirling   to   the   famous   Iron   works at   Carun ,   I   saw   the   Venerable   trunk   of   the   tree where   the   Patriot   Wallace   &   eight   of   his   followers once   lay   conceal'd ,   I   assure   you   I   honoured   this tree   far   more   than   our   Royal   Oak .   Lord   Kames carried   me   to   the   Caverns   of   Valean ,   the   very sighing   of   the   bellows   was   as   terrible   as   the modest   blast   of   Boreas   passing   over   the   Ocean On   Caron   banks   I   sought   for   the   sad   Comala , she   lies   pale   by   the   rock ,   &   the   wind   lifts   her hair ,   but   I   could   not   find   her .   We   dined   at a   Brother   of   Sr   Lawrence   Dundasses ,   were   entertained with   the   easy   politeness   peculiar   to   the   Scotch . at   night   I   got   back   to   Edinburgh   in   every   respect pleased   with   my   ramble ,   only   that   Ossian   did not   come   from   his   airy   hall   to   give   us   a   song . I   stayed   three   days   more   at   Edinburgh ,   passing the   evenings   with   Dr   Robertson   Dr   Blair   &   other litterati   .   My   next   journey   was   to   Sr   Gilbert   Elliots   a sweet   place   for   a   philosopher   or   Poet ,   the   quality   of the   latter   the   Master   is   well   deserving   of   it ,   for she   is   really   a   favourite   of   the   Muses .   In   my   road I   visited   the   ruins   of   the   Abbey   of   Mailross ,   a very   noble   &   elegant   Gothick   building   very   richly ornamented   with   carving   in   stone .   On   the   outsides there   is   a   great   deal   of   grotesque   sculpture ,   monkeys playing   on   bagpipes   &   other   droll   devices   that   little suit   Relentless   walls !   whose   darksome   round   contains repentant   sighs ,   &   voluntary   pains .   This   was   the richest   Abbey   in   Scotland ,   &   generally   the   appanage of   some   of   the   Royal   family ,   The   Douglas   who was   killed   by   Percy   at   Otterborn   lies   buried here .   &   the   Ld   of   Liddesdale   once   call'd   the   flower of   Chivalry .   The   situation   of   this   Abbey   is   solemn &   fine ,   it   is   rather   the   retreat   of   piety   than of   despair ,   it   solemn   but   not   gloomy .   The   figures of   the   Apostles   on   ye   outsides   are   fine   but one   does   not   love   to   see   them   in   such   wanton company   as   Fidlers   monkeys   & c .   I   spent   a very   agreable   day   at   Sr   Gilbert   Elliots ,   & went   from   thence   to   my   good   friend   the Bishop   of   Carlisles   at   Rose   Castle   in   Cumberland which   is   an   easy   days   journey   from   hence . I   dare   say   you   are   glad   I   am   got   home .   I   can   tell you   I   mean   another   visit   to   the   Highlands , &   to   cross   over   to   Ireland   &   visit   Mrs   Vesey   in   her sweet   Villa .   If   I   am   drown'd   in   the   passage , the   Caledonian   bards   sh=d shall   raise   the   song .   Leander shall   sink   into   oblivion ,   &   my   name   shall   float upon   the   river   of   Helicon .   However ,   this   being poetical   may   have   the   air   of   fiction ,   but I   do   certainly   intend   to   come   to   Lucan .   And   I hope   friendship   will   be   more   fortunate   than love ,   &   then   Leander   may   live   in   song ,   while   I live   in   Clover   at   Lucan .   I   beg   my   compts   to Mr   Vesey   &   Mrs   Hancock .   When   shall   we   meet at   a   feast   of   Shells ?   The   Bards   will   be assembling   &   your   Bard   feasting   friend   I   hope will   keep   a   merry   christmass   in   Hillstreet . A   Woeful   November   must   pass   here   I   am   so immersed   in   business   that   I   cannot   flatter myself   to   leave   this   place   before   Xmass I   am   Dr   Madm   Ever   Yrs E M 
BC_1766_EMONTAGU_FB	Sunday   ye   My   dear   Madam Cold   &   raw   the   north   doth   blow , and   all   the   Hills   are   cover d   with   snow . Such   is   my   sad   ditty ,   &   I   beg   you   to   set   it   to   melancholly musick ,   &   sing   it   pathetically   till   I   come   &   sing , London   is   a   fine   Town   & c .   I   hope   to   set   forward tomorrow   sennight   but   my   other   half   is   as pleased   here   as   if   he   was   in   the   Garden   of   Eden fanned   by   zephyrs   &   incensed   by   Flora .   I   hoped to   have   been   with   you   long   ago ,   but   Mr   Montagu has   been   obliged   to   part   with   his   Steward ,   finding he   had   taken   so   many   stewardships   &   affairs upon   him ,   he   did   none   of   them   well ;   so   who do   you   think   the   Gentleman   appointed   Receiver &   paymaster   in during   the   vacancy   but   his   beloved Wife ?   Poor   Woman !   she   has   had   a   great   deal   of trouble   &   fatigue ,   but   would   not   quit   her   post   till she   had   put   all   things   into   order   &   method ,   else perhaps   I   had   stolen   back   to   London ,   but   now I   am   obliged   to   wait   for   my   Landlord ,   who   you know   never   is   in   a   hurry .   We   had   very   mild weather   till   yesterday ,   &   then   there   came   a   violent wind   &   snow ,   &   it   is   horrible   to   behold   our   hills &   vallies .   You ,   I   suppose ,   are   indulging   yourself in   the   joys   of   society ,   the   fair   Duchess   come   to   Town , Mr   William   returnd   from   Sea ,   &   Sa   Sagesses   from school ,   &   never   think   of   those   who   shiver   under the   pole   star .   I   shall   come   to   Town   doucement   ,   for the   roads   are   rough ,   the   days   are   short ,   &   my precipitate   journey   this   summer   did   not   agree with   me .   Now   if   you   have   any   charity   you will   write   a   letter   about   this   day   sennight &   send   it   to   Hillstreet .   Our   porter   will   know at   what   Inn   to   send   my   letters   to   chear   me on   ye   road ,   &   you   may   give   me   le   carte   du pays   I   am   coming   to ,   tell   me   what   Lovers   are going   to   be   married ,   what   politicians   are contented   or   discontented ,   with   all   news   great &   small .   I   expect   a   most   dreary   journey ,   &   it will   be   a   great   pleasure ,   even   in   the   best   Inns best   room ,   to   receive   a   letter   from   my   dear friend .   If   you   write   by   tuesday   ye     it   will   end the   old   year   well ,   if   the   next   day   it   will   begin the   new   one   happily   to   me .   We   expect   our   fine Bride   in   the   Country   in   a   few   days ,   they   are to   keep   a   splendid   wedding .   I   hope   Love   will keep   them   warm ,   else   it   is   but   a   chill   kind of   a   project   to   come   into   Northumberland at   Xmass .   Miss   Windsor   has   kept   her   Nuptial feast   in   more   pleasant   regions .   I   should   think   it better   for   a   Bride   to   shine   at   Almacks   than to   glitter   amidst   the   hoar   frost .   To   tell   you   the truth   I   am   so   well   tired   of   the   Country   I   shall not   like   even   to   look   at   a   Landscape   these   months .   All   joy   attend   you ,   &   may   some   of it   appear   in   the   shape   of   a   little   Marquiss   of Worcester .   I   am   dear   Madam Ever   most   affectly   yours E Montagu 
BC_1767_EMONTAGU_EC_1	Thursday   ye   My   dear   friend , Enclosed   in   this   small   space   is   all   my knowledge   of   Fable ,   Allegory ,   &   what   not .   Please   to read   criticize   &   efface   with   all   ye   rigour   you   can that   I   may   as   well   as   possible   escape   ye   sneering witt   &   beetle   brow'd   Aristarchus .   I   shall   make   notes of   reference   to   l'histoire   des   lettres   &   also   give   at large   lAbbé   du   Bos .   Pray   was   there   a   tradition among   ye   Greeks   that   ye   Eumenides   pleaded   against Orestes   in   ye   Areopagus ?   Ld   Lyttelton   told   me he   imagined   by   ye   best   of   his   memory   that Demosthenes   mentions   it .   I   think   he   is   mistaken &   all   that   he   builds   this   upon   is ,   that   the Orator   boasted   of   Minerva's   being   present   there on   ye   tryal   of   Orestes .   If   the   Venerable   Goddesses were   to   come   into   our   Houses   of   Parliament how   frighted   wd   be   ye   Pension'd   crew !   &   poor Minerva   wd   be   a   mere   Old   maid   whom   no body   knows .   I   shall   leave   this   place   tomorrow or   saturday   sennight ,   but   if   you   can   send   this back   by   yr   post   on   monday   I   might   receive   it here   on   wensday   which   wd   be   convenient . Adieu   my   dear   friend   many   letters   to   write &   weather   that   advises   rather   to   walk .   I   am   quite well ,   I   long   to   hear   you   are   so . Ever   more   affectly Yrs E M If   you   dont   send   this   till after ye   time   mentiond direct   it   to   Mr   Montagu 
BC_1767_EMONTAGU_EC_2	Thursday   ye   th   Agst .   My   dear   friend I   am   much   obliged   to   you   for   yr annotations ,   in   many   I   agree   with   you ,   but   not as   to   Polyphemus   being   a   Giant   like   those of   Ariosto   &   Tasso .   The   Ghost   of   Hamlet   is   surely sullen   &   not   a   spirit   blest ,   if   we   may   take   ye   Ghosts word .   As   to   Ghosts   I   never   yet   heard   of   any person   who   gave   such   an   account   of   their appearance   as   shew'd   any   tolerable   art   of lying .   I   have   heard   more   artificial   tales   of Witches ,   &   indeed   have   read   some   that   were specious ,   &   yet   I   do   not   believe   them .   However if   there   are   not   ghosts   walking   about   in   Church yards   to   frighten   maid   Servants ,   a   Poet   only copies   ye   vulgar   tale .   I   dare   say   if   there   are is ever   permitted   to   these   Beings   to   appear ,   they do   not   resemble   what   we   are   told   of   them   in the   Nursery ,   &   I   speak   only   of   Nursery   Ghosts . Pere   Brumoy   says   ye   Greeks   allowd   ye   next   of Kin   to   avenge   a   murder ,   but   he   may   be   mistaken so   I   will   alter   ye   passage .   Homers   Pigmies have   not   ye   least   resembles resemblance   to   ye   Dwarfs in   Romance .   The   objection   you   make   to   my mentioning   Hecate   is   just ,   &   I   wish   Shakespear had   not   calld   his   witch   by   such   a   Heathenish name .   Milton   has   made   often   such   a   kind of   jumble .   Erictho   differs   much   from   a   parish witch ,   such   as   live   in   ye   solitary   Cottage   on   alms , nor   do   I   imagine   that   prophecy   was   a   part of   ye   Classick   Witches   talents ,   but   that   you know   better   than   I.   Whatever   remarks   you made   before ,   I   had   observed   and   given   place   to . I   wish'd   you   had   given   yr   opinion   as   to ye   general   doctrine   there   maintained   concerning fable   &   allegory   & c .   The   copy   I   sent you   was   full   of   blunders   &   words   left   out I   have   not   time   now   to   read   it   over   but a   slight   reading   I   saw   those   you   remark but   wanted   leisure   to   correct   them .   I   think there   is   surely   no   instance   in   the   Classick Authors   of   such   enchantments   as   those   in Ariosto   &   Tasso   &   Spenser .   Who   were   ye   Necromancers who   shut   people   up   in   Castles ?   dressed   up figures   that   represented   absent   persons ? made   voices   of   Lovers   call   their   beloved ,   & fierce   foes   give   challenges   all   in   delusion ? Minerva   in   ye   Ajax   of   Sophocles   set   her   witt in   a   wonderfull   manner   against   ye poor   Hero ,   but   she   is   not   a   Witch ,   &   other Deities   deluded   a   Hero   they   disliked   in favour   of   another   they   protected .   I   am   glad   you have   got   Mrs   Dunbar   in   yr   neighbourhood   as   to our   Sylph   I   know   not   any   thing   of   her ,   but   intend to   advertize   her .   Miss   Freinds   match   is   a   notable enterprize .   The   Mr   Campbell   you   have   seen   at my   House   is   the   Person .   He   is   a   Lieutent   of Marines   &   of   a   good   family ,   &   puis   c'est   tout Nor   did   avail   ye   entreaties   of   her   Mother   & Uncles   when   they   desired   her   to   desist   from her   project   so   to   make   ye   best   of   ye   matter they   assented .   I   hope   they   will   do   what   they can   to   promote   him   now   that   nothing   better can   be   done .   Never   was   there   such   a   headstrong obstinate   girl .   I   think   indiscreet   as   she   was it   is   fortunate   she   got   a   man   of   merits character   &   family .   She   promised   to   marry him   before   she   knew   whether   he   was   a Gentleman   except   from   his   own   account   of himself .   I   shall   not   be   easy   till   yr   unfortunate Servant   is   removed .   Her   waking   you   out   of yr   sleep   makes   one   shudder .   I   am   in   no little   bustle   on   this   journey   to   Town .   I   shall be   in   Town   on   saturday   &   stay   till   wensday . I   am   ever ,   my   dear   friend   most   affectly yrs E M I   will   write   to   you   from   London before   I   set   out   &   I   may   hear from   you   on   tuesday . 
BC_1767_EMONTAGU_EV	Denton   Sept   ye     Dear   Madam My   expedition   hither   having   been by   various   things   retarded ,   my   dear   Mrs   Veseys   letter lay   sometime   in   expectation   of   my   arrival ,   &   so   much business   crouded   in   upon   me ,   that   this   is   the   first leisure   moment   I   have   had   to   answer   it .   I   imagine that   you   will   soon   be   leaving   the   watery   element , therefore   I   shall   reserve   till   I   hear   you   have   landed on   some   stable   shore ,   an   account   of   what   I   have   been doing   since   I   set   my   face   northward ;     lacks   my description   of   Mr   Aislabies   Hackfall ,   the   magnificence of   Alnwick   Castle   &   its   Environs   & c .   When   I   know   my letter   will   certainly   find   you ,   it   shall   be   full   of   a thousand   little   details ,   interesting   to   a   friend ,   but   which wd   only   tire   the   Post   master   of   Scarborough ,   who   very probably   may   be   the   sole   proprietor   of   what   I   am now   writing .   I   find   you   never   received   a   letter   I   wrote to   you   directed   to   Lady   Primrose .   Pray   my   dear   friend why   did   you   run   such   hazard   of   becoming   a   Mermaid . It   has   been   long   established ,   that   you   are   the   most amiable   Woman   upon   Earth ,   but   I   much   doubt   whether you   would   obtain   any   great   consideration   in   the vast   Ocean .   If   the   Porpusses   ask'd   you   to   a   feast ,   they would   think   you   made   a   poor   figure   amongst them .   The   Stationary   nation   of   Oysters ,   would   behold with   horror ,   a   being   that   cannot   rest     minutes in   a   place .   All   the   species   of   flat   fish   are ,   I   dare say ,   a   very   dull   set   of   people .   When   the   Seas   rare high ,   the   Collision   with   the   Testaceous   &   Crustaceous inhabitants   of   the   Deep ,   wd   certainly   be   more   unpleasant than   being   squeezed   amongst   hoops   &   Swords   at a   rout .   Sea   Calves   must   be   more   uncouth   than even   the   young   Squires   of   England   or   Ireland ,   &   in short ,   I   see   no   resource   for   you   but   in   the   Gentle Nations   of   Dolphins :   some   descendant   of   him ,   who for   his   musicks   sake ,   carried   Arion   on   his   back to   shore ,   in   consideration   of   the   dulcet   &   harmonious sounds ,   &   still   sweeter   meaning   of   apt   discourse ,   would have   wafted   you   to   Land .   But   to   be   serious ,   the   representation of   your   danger   made   me   shudder .   I   beg   of   you , to   let   me   know ,   where   I   may   throw   my   letters   at you ,   for   I   long   to   be   able   to   direct   my   words   to the   person   to   whom   my   thoughts   are   so   continually pointed .   I   have   been   wonderfully   harried   since   my arrival   hither   by   receiving   &   paying   visits ,   &   giving the   necessary   attention   to   business .   I   have   the pleasure   to   find   every   thing   going   on   with   great regularity   &   prosperity   in   the   Colliery ,   &   enjoy ,   to a   high   degree ,   the   famous   Sr   Gilbert   Heathcotes first   beatitude ,   settling   an   account   with   the   balance in   ones   favour .   I   am   not   so   fam'd   by   nature   as Sr   Gilbert   to   taste   this   felicity ,   however   I   relish the   pleasure   of   success   ,   in   a   point   of   importance &   hope   wealth   has   pleasures   for   those   who yet   delight   in   the   metal .   At   Alnwick   Castle   we met   with   the   Mr   Percy   who   publishd   the   relique of   ancient   poetry ;   as   there   is ,   you   know ,   a   po - establish'd   harmony   between   me   &   all   poet shewd   me   great   attentions ,   &   was   my   Cicerone in   visiting   an   old   abbey ,   the   first   in   England dedicated   to   the   Carmelite   Order .   Mr   Percy   is   a very   agreable   Wellbred   man ,   &   will   make   a good   addition   to   our   Sect   of   blue   stocking   Philosophers I   wish   you   would   ramble   into   Northumberland York   Cathedral   is   well   worth   your   seeing .   from thence   to   Durham   is   but   a   days   journey ,   there I   wd   meet   you ,   or   wherever   you   pleased ,   &   be   your guide   &   Damsel   Errant   to   Denton ,   &   from   then   whence your   vagrant   genius   wd   prompt   you .   My   compts   attend Mrs   Hancock .   I   hope   you   have   at   last   found   benefit   by your   marine   regimen . I   am   Dr   Madam   ever   yrs   E Montagu 
BC_1767_EMONTAGU_GL	Hillstreet   tuesday nov   ye   My   Lord I   should   have   been   more   uneasy at   not   hearing   from   your   Lordship   in   so   long a   time   if   I   had   not   heard   of   you .   At   last   your letter   made   me   great   amends   for   waiting   so   long for   it ,   as   it   assured   me ,   that   your   Lordship   enjoy'd a   greater   share   of   domestick   happiness   than before .   I   hope   Mr   Lyttelton   will   be   reconciled   to virtue ,   he   parted   with   her   from   the   petulance   of youth ,   &   the   delusions   of   an   exorbitant   vanity :   he was   not   depraved   by   disposition .   Time   will   correct his   levity ,   &   his   vanity   has   been   severely   mortified , so   that   I   hope   to   see   him   again   amiable   &   good . Your   Lordship   knows   I   never   despair'd   of   him . I   am   rejoyced   that   Lady   Anglesey   is   so   happy . Lord   Angleseys   understanding ,   good   person   & wellbred   manner ,   will   recommend   him   to   the World ,   &   assist   greatly   in   surmounting   the prejudice   against   him .   I   should   have   answerd your   Lordships   letter   as   soon   as   I   thought   you   return'd   to   Hagley , but   I   was   at   that   time   greatly   indisposed with   a   feverish   cold   &   disorder   upon   my   nerves . Last   saturday   sennight   I   left   Denton .   I   stopp d a   few   days   at   a   Friends   house   in   Yorkshire ,   & then   came   on   to   London ,   where   I   arrived   on Sunday .   I   left   all   Mr   Montagus   affairs   in   Yorkshire &   Northumberland   in   great   order .   the Colliery   prospers   extreamly ,   &   tho   the   Coal   trade is   in   general   bad ,   we   have   made   more   money of   our   Colliery   than   we   expected   to   have   done even   in   good   times .   All   these   things   I   effected without   giving   Mr   Montagu   any   trouble ,   he pass'd   his   whole   summer   in   Berkshire .   He   gives me   great   praise   for   my   notable   managment , &   indeed   I   think   I   deserve   some   commendations for   my   diligence   &   application .   I   have   taken an   infinite   deal   of   pains   &   with   success .   I   should have   returnd   sooner   to   the   South ,   but   Mr Montagu's   Steward   was   prevented   coming down   to   the   North   at   the   time   he   had   intended , and   as   Mr   Montagus   estates   in   Northumberland &   Yorkshire   were   to   be   raised   &   Leases   for     years to   be   granted ,   the   Steward   intreated   me   to   stay for   his   treating   with   the   Tenants ,   &   I   had   the pleasure   of   seeing   that   scheme   also   succeed . So   much   business   tho   accompanied   with   satisfaction has   worn   me   very   thin ,   &   my   health   has   not been   good ,   but   I   attribute   much   of   my   indisposition to   the   bad   summer .   I   am   now   much   better   and intend   to   indulge   myself   in   ease   &   idleness Your   Lordships   letter   directed   to   Sandleford   came safe   to   my   hands ,   you   there   regret   the   absense of   our   friend   Woodhouse .   I   have   taken   from Apollo   to   give   him   to   Ceres ,   who   is   a   more benignant   Deity   &   feeds   her   Votaries   better . Mr   Montagu   is   extreamly   delighted   with Woodhouse   &   not   a   little   fond   of   his   boy   who is   your   Lordships   Godson   &   his .   I   am   convinced that   he   will   be   a   Poet   from   his   God   Father &   Father   &   he   is   realy   a   surprizing   child in   his   apprehension ,   &   beautifull   as   a   Cherubim . Mr   Woodhouse   honour'd   my   Birthday   with a   better   ode   than   our   Sovereigns   get   for Jack   &   pension .   He   does   no   call   me   Penthesilea , or   by   the   name   of   any   Heroine ,   but   he   gives me   the   preference   to   the   Heroes   &   Alexanders to   which   the   Laureates   compare   their   Kings . The   Duke   of   York   is   to   be   buried   tomorrow , not   only   in   the   Vault   of   the   Abby ,   but   in   the dark   abyss   of   Oblivion ,   where   great   titles   without great   characters   are   soon   swallow'd   up .   I   imagine by   next   week   he   will   be   as   much   forgot   as any   of   the   blood   royal   of   the   Heptarchy . There   was   an   appearance   of   good   nature   & humanity ,   join'd   with   fortitude ,   in   his behaviour   on   his   death   bed ,   that   makes   me wish   he   had   lived   in   times   of   more   seriousness   & dignity .   In   former   days   the   Great , by   certain   constraints   &   restraints ,   acted above   themselves ,   above   their   natural character .   The   dissipation   &   familiarity   now in   vogue   sinks   them   below   it .   By   help   of   a peaked   beard ,   a   clear   starch'd   ruff ,   a   little Spanish   gravity ,   &   proud   reserve ,   this   Harlequin Prince   had   perhaps   pass'd   for   a   Man   of acute   parts .   Genl   Pulteneys   Funeral   is   deferd till   after   ye   Royal   Obsequies .   I   suppose   in   the mean   time   his   Soul   hovers   over   his   money in   the   Stocks .   He   was   loth   to   dye ,   &   did   not care   to   see   any   of   those   Persons   who   even by   his   own   appointment   were   to   inherit his   wealth .   He   considerd   his   relations   merely as   expectants   of   what   he   did   not   like   to   quit . Hearing   a   coach   drive   into   ye   Court   he   askd who   was   come ?   his   Servants   said   Mrs   Pulteney , Pho   says   he ,   she   is   come   too   soon ,   there   is a   great   deal   for   her   but   not   yet .   No   friend embalms   his   memory   with   a   tear ,   or   smooth'd the   bed   of   death   with   kind   attendance ,   unloved &   unloving   he   lived   &   dyed .   I   believe   the   news papers   account   of   his   his   Will   is   authentick . I   was   much   alarmd   by   a   paragraph   in   the papers   of   the   Bishop   of   Carlisles   being   dangerously ill ,   but   upon   writing   to   one   Porter   here   to call   at   his   House ,   I   had   the   pleasure   to   hear he   was   well .   I   imagine   Hagley   must   look   very beautifull   in   its   autumnal   robe ,   but   I   hope you   will   consider   the   winter   will   soon   strip off   its   ornaments ,   &   that   your   Lordship   will soon   be   in   Town .   I   propose   to   go   to   Sandleford on   friday   but   I   shall   stay   only   three   or   four   days &   then   return   to   Hillstreet .   I   imagine   that even   in   the   Elysian   fields   at   Howe   your   Lordship heard   a   great   deal   of   politicks .   Dr   Monseys mackrel   upon   a   gravel   walk   does   not   seem to   me   more   improperly   situated   than   an ambitious   Politician   by   the   side   of   a   gentle murmuring   rill .   Charles   Townshends   death seems   to   have   done   Ld   Chathams   nerves a   great   deal   of   good .   I   hear   from   Bath   that he   is   in   perfect   health .   He   has   sold   ye Pinsent   estate   to   Sr   Fludyer   for   , L reserving   to   himself   the   House   &   garden and   some   little   ground .   I   hope   his   next   legacy will   be   in   America ,   &   then   he   will   not mortgage   or   squander   it ,   for   he   has   great tenderness   for   American   property .   I   shall be   impatient   to   hear   your   Lordship   is coming   to   London .   November   has   great   merit with   me   as   it   assembles   together   the   friends the   gaudy   june   had   inticed   away . I   am   my   Lord Your   Lordships   most   Obedient Most   faithfull   Hble   Servt E Montagu 
BC_1767_EMONTAGU_SS	From   our   Palace   in   Hillstreet jany   ye   My   dear   Sister To   the   great   joy   of   my   mind   and ease   &   comfort   of   my   person   I   am   well   &   warmly lodged   in   my   own   habitation   in   Hillstreet . My   dressing   room   is   really   wonderfully   pretty . Mr   Adam   has   done   his   best ,   he   has   exerted   much genius   on   the   doors   in   emulation   of   his   Rival Stewart .   I   assure   you   the   dressing   room   is   now just   the   female   of   the   great   room ,   for   sweet attractive   grace ,   for   winning   softness ,   for delicacy ,   for   le   je   ne   scai   quoi   it   is   incomparable , upon   the   whole   I   am   really   well   lodged ,   but had   the   rooms   been   hung   with   mock   flock paper ,   or   even   with   Herods   cruel   face   in vile   tapestry   I   shd   have   been   pleased   to   have got   home   after   such   a   dismal   cold   journey . Mr   Richardson   is   dead   at   Pensacola ,   what are   his   testamentary   dispositions   we   know not ,   it   is   said   he   left   a   Will   at   Plymouth .   I   wish he   may   have   left   every   thing   to   his   Sister independant   of   her   Husband   who   loves   money better   than   he   ought   to   do .   The   whole   Town is   in   amazement   at   Lord   Barry-res   having disappointed   the   fair   Lady   even   when   she was   dress d   for   the   Nuptials ,   the   Parson waiting ,   friends   assembled ,   &   all   things   prepard . the   expected   Bridegroom   sent   word   he   was ill ,   refuses   to   admit   her   relations ,   &   no   one knows   what   is   the   cause   of   this   sudden change .   My   Father   has   had   an   intermitting fever   but   is   well   again .   My   little   Matt   has been   ill   so   I   have   not   yet   seen   him .   My Bror   Morris   looks   well .   I   graciously   ask'd   after Madams   health .   I   am   not   at   all   the   worse for   my   journey .   we   got   here   last   night . My   friend   Mrs   Vesey   did   also   get   to   Town that   night .   Mrs   Carter   will   be   here   on monday .   Mrs   Boscawen   came   to   me   last   night she   is   very   happy   that   ye   Dss   of   Beaufort has   got   a   fine   boy .   I   was   very   fortunate in   finishing   my   journey   yesterday   for this   was   one   of   ye   most   terrible   days   I   ever beheld   &   to   night   the   wind   sounds   hollow &   terrible .   Mrs   Freind   is   expected   in   Town to   night .   I   could   not   help   grieving   when I   came   here   to   think   my   House   had   the honour   of   receiving   you   while   I   was too   far   off   to   enjoy   yr   company ,   &   now I   am   come   back   you   are   gone   away .   fye ! Monsay   had   the   honour   to   cure   Papas   ague , for   which   he   sets   him   above   the   deifyed Æsulapius   with   ye   Golden   beard . I   am   my   dear   Sister   most   affectionately and   faithfull yours E Montagu 
BC_1768_EMONTAGU_EC_1	July     I   could   only   send   my   dear   Friend when   I   wrote   last   a   brief   account   of   myself ,   for   between attending   Mr   Montagu   in   his   very   infirm   state , domestick   orders   for   ye   regulation   of   a   family consisting   of   about   thirty   Persons ,   Letters   of   business , &   my   author-like   duties ,   I   have   sometimes   a   great hurry ,   &   I   have   also   some   sick   patients   for   whom I   am   obliged   to   make   up   medicines ,   that   being in   some   cases   not   to   be   trusted   to   another .   Poor Shakespear   is   last   served ,   &   I   believe   will   be   worst   served   . I   am   sure   I   ought   to   say   I   hope   so ,   for   he   will   not feel   any   uneasiness   from   my   mistakes   or   omissions . If   his   Ghost   was   not   better   engaged   that   to   attend to   what   happend   here ,   there   are   certain   Commentators whose   curtains   he   wd   mightily   shake ,   if   he meddles   with   mine ,   I   shall   say   get   thee   to   thy Elysian   Groves ,   for   I   have   not   mixd   my   nonsense with   thy   sense ,   as   others   have   done .   In   my   work they   lye   as   distinct   as   the   cloth   of   Frieze   & cloth   over of   Gold   in   the   Duke   of   Suffolks   Caparisons . All   I   have   done ,   is   what   is   often   done ,   to   thy great   Master   Phœbus ,   &   he   takes   it   not   amiss . I   have   presented   a   smoak'd   glass   through   which thy   Countrymen   may   fixedly   look   upon those   beauties   in   thy   work   which   were   too   dazzling   bright to   suit   the   sense   of   mortal   sight .   Go   therefore &   torture   those   who   have   tortured   thee ,   frighten those   out   of   their   Witts   who   have   endeavourd to   bereave   thee   of   thine   making   thee   utter   that   nonsence that   didst   never   conceive .   Nothing   can   be   laid to   my   charge   but   the   rashness   of   undertaking a   task   too   difficult   for   my   capacity ,   &   talents ,   & says   I ,   Master   Ghost ,   unless   you   have   guzzled   too much   of   the   oblivious   lake   in   the   other   World , &   so   have   forgot   the   human   nature   you   once   so   well   understood   you   will not   be   angry   with   me   for   not   knowing   myself . So   then   away   he   goes   to   B-   &   W-   &   undraws his   curtains ,   &   with   an   angry   voice   awakes   him ,   to   the great   surprize   of   the   Ghost   &   Commentator   together   to   make   up their   matters   as   they   can .   The   Tirades   is   as   you say ,   a   perfect   tragedy ,   without   a   gleam   of   mirth full   fancy ,   &   it   is   very   touching ,   but   by   the by ,   one   gives   ones   pitty   to   the   calamity   as   one does   ones   money   to   a   ragged   beggar   without respect   to   personal   character ,   I   mean   as   far as   regards   to   Hecuba ,   who   is   a   mere   old   Woman : &   she   says   Oh   my   back !   &   Oh   my   sides !   just   like the   Old   nurse   in   Romeo   &   Juliet   she   laments her   hard   bed   & c .   One   shd   have   been   more   nobly   touchd if   she   had   mention'd   the   scornfull   looks   of the   Grecian   Dames   which   wd   be   cast   on   the   Mother of   Hector   &   the   Queen   of   Troy   in   her   fallen   state   The   character   Andromeda gives   of   herself   is   noble ,   that   such   a   Wife ,   such a   Matron ,   shd   be   a   Captive   is   grievous .   The part   of   Cassandra   is   exessively   fine ,   &   is   as   I   remember well   imitated   in   parts   by   Thompson   in   his   Agamemnon . How   finely ,   in   a   faint   perspective ,   does   Cassandra shew   the   future   travels   of   Ulysses !   There   is   a   wonderfull beauty   in   the   prophetick   part   of   Cassandra , &   a   noble   spirit   in   the   consolation   she   draws , that   by   her   means ,   her   Parents   &   Country   will be   avenged .   This   tragedy   shews   a   fine   dramatick genius ,   it   is   indeed   an   imitation   of   the   sentiments , discourses ,   &   actions   of   Men ,   &   therefore   excites a   sympathy   that   is   very   strong .   Andromaches envy   of   the   dead   Polixena   is   worthy   the   Widow of   Hector .   Hecuba   rises   in   ones   opinion   when she   glories   not   in   ye   number   but   virtue   of her   Children ,   however   upon   the   whole ,   I   think the   Mother   of   Hector   shd   have   been   a   higher character .   When   Shakespear   produces   King   Lear exposed   to   the   stormy   night ,   it   is   not   by   his   being wet   &   cold   that   he   makes   you   pity   him ,   the storm   only   heightens   the   offence   done   by   him by   his   Children   in   turning   him   out   of   doors ,   it   is true ,   the   Spectator   finds   a   subject   for   pity   in   it , but   how   finely   does   Shakespear   make   the   old King   bid   his   followers   shelter   themselves   from its   violence ,   but   express   that   he   has   a   great storm   within ,   &   that   by   diverting   his   thoughts it   rather   alleviates   than   aggravates   his sorrow !   External   evils   have   their   known   limits , the   minds   sufferings   we   cannot   measure , therefore   the   tragick   Poet   shd   move   by   them . Shakespear   very   judiciously ,   in   my   opinion , in   all   the   reasons   Hamlet   enumerates   for laying   down   the   burthen   of   life ,   never reckons   one   bodily   evil .   However   I   have   written all   this   very   hastily ,   &   you   will   tell   me   where I   am   right   where   wrong .   I   am   hurried   to make   up   a   medicine   for   a   poor   Woman   whom I   sent   to   Dr   Collet   this   morning   in   my post   chaise ,   so   if   I   have   said   rash   things of   the   Grecian   Bard   correct   me .   Indeed   in some   respects ,   &   in   that   great   point   of   realizing a   story ,   he   appears   to   me   unequalled .   I   dont like   the   dialogue   of   Neptune   &   Pallas   at   all . Nor   do   I   percieve   its   utility .   That   Cassandra shd   prophetically   disclose   the   fate   of   the Greeks   is   well   imagined   &   there   is   something great   in   her   prophetick   fury ,   &   a   fine   obscurity in   her   tale .   Poor   Neptune   might   say   when he   was   out   of   his   element ,   as   Ld   Grantham the   Queens   Chamberlain   used ,   that   when he   was   not   in   Court ,   he   was   like   a   Goose out   of   water .   I   wish   Neptune   wd   go   to   Sea .   Madme   Minerva   she   had   better   take   her spinning   wheel   than   come   like   an   idle Gossip   on   ye   Stage .   Adieu   my   Dear   Friend   make my   compts   acceptable   to   all   your   family   & to   Mrs   Underdown .   We   have   got   fine   weather to   day .   I   have   sympathized   a   little   with   yr head   achs   lately   but   to   day   I   am   free   from   it . I   am   always   my   Dear   Madm most   affectly   yrs E M I   sent   a   frank   in   hopes of   a   double   letter 
BC_1768_EMONTAGU_EC_2	ye     Sept   My   Dear   Friend I   fear d   you   would   find   bad   effect from   the   excessive   wet   weather ,   &   my   fears   are too   well   confirm'd .   I   have   felt   the   influence   of   this humid   atmosphere   pretty   severely   in   the   continual uneasiness   in   my   jaws   &   face .   You   may   be   assured that   round   faced   Mary   &   Israel ,   now   Bride &   Bridegroom ,   will   do   every   thing   in   their power   to   accommodate   you ;   &   there   is   always a   well   aired   bed ,   so   tho   my   own   bed   is   taken down   to   be   cleaned ,   I   wd   still   recommend my   House   preferably   to   Mrs   Dunbars ,   for   if they   do   not   leave   a   man   Servant   in Town   I   think   it   not   so   safe   to   be   in   a   House at   this   time   of   year ,   when   so   many   families are   out   of   Town ,   &   I   flatter   myself   you   will like   to   sit   in   my   dressing   room ,   &   generously send   me   a   reverie   at   leisure   moments .   I   had a   charming   letter   from   the   Sylph   last   post ,   &   the most   charming   of   many   charming   things it   contain'd ,   was   an   assurance   of   her   coming to   us   this   Winter .   Mr   Vesey   wd   have   her precede   him   but   like   a   true   good   Wife ,   she   will wait   for   his   accompanying   her ,   by   which she   will   retard   the   welcome   her   Friends   wd give   her   here   &   embarass   his   Adieux   to   the   Belles he   is   to   leave   behind .   Sweet   Sylph !   the   Rooks that   fly   over   her   head   seem   to   her   to   be Orators   Poets   &   beaux   esprits   ,   &   thro   the   grate of   a   ruin'd   Nunnery   she   fancies   she   hears the   whispers   of   Athenian   maids ,   such   sweet forebodings   has   she   of   Ld   Lyttelton ,   Mr   Burke , Mrs   Carter   &   all   ye   Worthies   of   the   society of   her   round   room .   I   care   not   how   soon   the winter   winds   compell   us   to   take   shelter in   the   Walled   City .   Never   did   the   Summer scatter   so   few   pleasures   in   its   flight ,   it   shook down   deluges   of   rain ,   &   if   there   was   any glowing   sky   it   seem'd   forging   thunder   bolts for   a   stormy   evening   succeeded   every   fine day .   The   Barley   harvest   is   very   unfortunate there   will   be   a   great   deal   of   bad   wheat ,   the quantity   will   lower   the   price ,   especialy   in the   early   part   of   the   Winter ,   for   the   bad wheat   will   not   be   fit   for   reserving   in   the granary .   Mr   Montagu   is   surprizingly   mended within   these   few   days .   I   am   endeavouring to   perswade   him   to   go   to   London   before the   winter   attacks   him ,   but   I   cannot   yet perceive   that   my   eloquence ,   great   as   it   is ,   has made   much   impression .   I   am   very   solicitous   to hear   of   Mrs   Underdowns   perfect   health .   It   is vexatious   that   Mrs   Talbots   House   shd   be   so   long   getting ready   for   their   reception .   I   think   our   Nobility have   nobly   entertaind   the   Royal   Dane   but does   not   your   antient   Go st   for   ye   Gothick   ceremonie   make   you wish   for   Tilts   &   Turnaments ?   I   wd   have   the two   Monarchs   only   break   a   Lance ,   but   it   wd be   pretty   to   see   the   Ministry   &   ye   Opposition tilting   a   toute   Outrance Oultrance .   The   late   great   Commoner   & and   a   certain   popular   Gentleman   for   one   match wd   do   admirably   well .   All   Arthurs   &   the   Newmarket Heroes   should   be   making   betts   ye   while .   I   hope the   King   of   Denmark   will   spend   his   merry Christmass   with   us .   I   want   to   see   some   of   these gallantee   shews   that   are   made   for   his   amusement . I   have   a   great   loss   in   Lady   Hervey .   In   her   society one   tasted   ye   rare   pleasure   of   general   conversation polite   &   ingenious   herself   she   communicated these   qualities   to   her   company ,   every   one   appeard better   there   than   in   any   other   place .   They were   pleasing   because   they   seemd   pleased ,   &   that reserve   which   makes   ye   most   sensible   Nation   in the   World   perhaps   the   least   agreable   in   society was   laid   aside .   No   person   at   her   table ,   at   by her   fireside   had   the   arrogant   vanity   of   shining alone ,   nor   the   pitifull   pride   of   being   afraid   to speak   least   they   should   not   shine ;   they   forgot   whether they   were   or   were   not   accounted   witts   &   genius's &   rememberd   only   they   were   her   Guests ,   &   as   such to   endeavour   to   be   agreable   to   her   &   the   company . 
BC_1768_EMONTAGU_EC_3	My   Dear   friend My   last   letter   wd   inform   my   Dear   Friend that   all   was   over   with   poor   Miss   Sutton .   I   believe   she   lived like   one   who   never   forgot   she   was   one   day   to   dye . The   Duke   of   Newcastle   this   morning   finish'd   his course .   I   believe   time   will   be   a   Friend   to   his   Fame , &   future   Ministrys   a   foil   to   his   Administration ,   which if   not   glorious   was   not   infamous   &   if   not   wise was   how   ever   discreet .   I   pity   the   poor   Duchess   who went   to   Bath   very   ill   on   condition   she   shd   be   sent for   if   the   Duke   grew   worse ,   his   Grace   on   being struck   with   ye   palsey   immediately   desired her   by   a   short   letter   to   come   to   Town   &   sent   an express .   her   Physician   Dr   Charlton   wd   not   suffer it   to   be   deliver'd ,   another   express   urging   her   return she   was   acquainted   with   his   danger   &   then   but too   late   set   out .   The   Duke   express'd   a   desire   to see   her   so   that   this   Doctor   by   his   care   has perhaps   made   ye   poor   Woman   unhappy   for   ye   rest of   her   life .   The   Duke   dyed   much   resignd   surely an   old   Minister   of   State   must   quit   this   World with   little   regret ,   for   treachery   &   ingratitude must   have   disgusted   him ,   to   have   so   long   so complicated   an   account   for   an   other   World   is perplexing   to   ye   mind .   I   was   at   Court   this   morning &   I   dined   at   Shelburne   where   I   saw   Mrs   John Pitt   fair   &   blooming   Mr   Pitt   &   she   are   to   be here   tomorrow   evening .   Miss   Finch   &   Miss   Fraine were   at   Lady   Shelburnes .   They   are   very   well . Mr   Cambridge   inquired   after   you .   I   have   only   time to   add   that   I   am   ever   most   faithfully   &   affectly Yrs E M It   is   not   yet   known   whether Mr   Wilkes   will   be   expelld There   was   to   be   a   motion   in the   H:   of   Commons   to   day   desiring   that   ye instructions   to   Ld   Rochford   concerning   Corsica might   be   laid   before   ye   House .   I   hope   you   are a   Corsican . 
BC_1768_EMONTAGU_EC_4	Dec   ye   My   Dear   Friend I   am   afraid   this   worst   of   weathers has   no   good   effect   on   your   health ,   perhaps   indeed the   Sea   breezes   may   bring   you   a   supply   of air   fit   for   respiration .   we   have   here   a   strange atmosphere ,   but   still   I   rejoyce   that   I   am in   London ,   for   with   all   its   fogs   &   faults   it is   surely   much   better   to   be   where   ye   Earth has   a   Coat   of   Stone ,   than   where   from the   Surface   to   the   Center   it   is   all   moist &   wet .   I   hope   there   will   be   calm   weather for   the   gentle   Vesey   whenever   she   sets forward .   Lady   Ann   Dawson   does   not   intend to   be   in   Town ,   she   will   reside   near   her   Sister Lady   Louise   Clayton .   The   Royal   Christening was   performd   last   night ,   it   was   very   brilliant . Lady   Shelburne   calld   in   me   after   ye   Ceremony &   she   was   so   illuminated   with   jewels ,   &   radiant with   gold   silver ,   that   she   must   have   added splendor   even   to   that   magnificent   assembly . Lady   Frances   Coningesbye   &   Mrs   Trevor   seem very   well   this   year .   The   young   Dss   of   Beaufort expects   every   hour   to   encrease   ye   family . I   believe   as   you   do   ye   Court   place   will be   an   additional   grief   to   ye   Dowager . As   far   of   the   office   as   lies   in   the   Stable his   Grace   will   relish .   I   wish   ye   office   were more   lucrative .   Poor   Madme   de   Sêclesne   is still   very   ill   tho   better .   How   terrible   to   be sick   in   a   Foreign   Land   &   without   a   Friend ! I   truly   pity   her .   I   dont   hear   that   yr   Sister Chudleigh   has   yet   perfectly   establish d   her Virginity ,   but   her   Lawyers   assure   her   she will   be   able   to   do   it ,   not   I   suppose   by   empannelling a   jury   of   Matrons .   It   is   odd   enough that   while   she   sues   Mr   Augustus   Hervey for   jactitations   of   marriage ,   Tom   Hervey sues   his   Wife   in   ye   same   way ,   &   tho   it   is it   is   commonly   most   difficult   to   prove a   negative ,   Miss   Chudleigh   will   triumph over   her   Hervey ,   ye   other   must   submit to   be   the   Husband   of   the   Lady   who   claims him ,   for   she   will   prove   herself   his   Wife . She   has   not   had   so   many   Children   as Virgin   C-h ,   but   I   believe   has   had   or   .   The   Duke   of   G-   is   to   be   divorced from   bed   &   board   but   not   to   have   a   power to   remarry .   There   are   new   comedies   on   ye Stage ,   but   I   have   not   seen   them ,   not   that I   have   been   deterd   from   it   by   fear   of   immoderate laughter   or   weeping ,   for   who   laughs or   crys   at   Modern   Comedy   or   Tragedy ? I   have   been   unwell   &   uncomfortable with   all   this   wet   weather ,   but   I   am   now what   in   our   part   of   Kent   we   call indifferent   well   .   Mr   Montagu   has   a return   of   his   cough   which   I   fear   will abide   with   him   through   ye   Winter how   ever   he   is   not   yet   so   bad   as   last   year &   even   goes   out .   Ld   Lyttelton   Bishp   of   Carlisle &   Mr   &   Mrs   Hood   are   to   dine   here .   Pray present   my   best   respects   to   all   yr   family . I   heartily   wish   success   to   yr   acid   regimen but   such   weather   flesh   &   blood   cannot bear   without   feeling   some   bad   effects . I   am   my   Dear   Friend   Ever   most   affectly Yrs   E M My   stick   goes   on   too   slow , I   wd   cheat   as   Milk   Women too   with   their   tallies   if   I thought   you   wd   respect   my reckoning . 
BC_1768_EMONTAGU_EC_5	ye     Dec My   Dear   Friend I   was   under   great   anxiety   about you   before   I   had   your   letter ,   as   you   were   so   much out   of   order   when   you   wrote   before .   I   wish   the   Physical faculty   could   find   out   what   cause   yr   feverish disorder   arises   from ;   for   tho   it   does   not   reduce   you to   the   skeleton   state   as   it is   usual   with   that   distemper , it   must   wear   you   tho   invisibly ,   &   hurt   &   burn   up   the   internal while   the   external   seems   plump   &   moist ,   &   from   this uncommon   circumstance   it   should   seem   to   arise from   no   usual   cause ,   &   therefore   not   to   be   cured by   common   methods .   I   fear   there   is   some   great obstruction   in   the   circulation ,   &   tho   the   acids   may have   some   effect   for   the   time ,   they   do   not   do any   thing   towards   a   cure ,   but   leave   you   still suffering   in   the   continual   heat   of   a   hectick ,   which is   of   all   things   grievous .   I   heard   of   a   Person   ye other   day   cured   of   a   constant   fever   by   repeated purges   which   carried   off   a   redundance   of   Bile . The   poor   Bishop   of   Carlisle   is   very   dangerously ill   of   a   Catarrh .   Lord   Lyttelton   has   been   ill   but is   well   again .   I   was   at   Mrs   J   Pitts   on   monday night ,   many   of   our   Friends   were   assembled   there Mrs   Dunbar   amongst   them   at   whose   House   I was   to   have   been   last   night   but   was   prevented by   the   head   ach .   Mrs   Vesey   &   Mrs   Handcock   have had   colds   but   are   better .   The   Sylph   says   she   got cold   looking   at   ye   prospects   in   her   journey ,   a Person   of   less   taste   wd   have   drawn   up   the   windows . She   was   much   alarm'd   about   Mrs   Handcock   for some   days   but   without   any   real   cause   however she   is   getting   well   very   fast .   Their   House   is   in a   sad   pickle   below   stairs   with   ye   floods .   The   Sylph has   been   entirely   taken   up   with   Mrs   Handcock   &   Lady Primrose   but   as   they   are   both   better   I   hope   one shall   enjoy   her   company .   I   wrote   this   last   night but   some   rhubarb   I   had   taken   in   the   morning behaved   in   such   ungentle   sort   I   could   not   write any   more .   I   was   at   Court   this   morning   with Mrs   Pulteney .   She   seems   pure   well ,   she   was with   me   on   sunday   evening .   Mr   Pulteney   has carried   his   controverted   election   for   Cromartie with   the   H:   of   Commons ,   the   adverse   party durst   not   abide   ye   decision   but   retreated . I   calld   at   ye   Sylphs   as   I   came   home   but she   was   at   dinner   for   Sylphs   dine .   She   had been   out   to   take   ye   air .   Mrs   Handcock   is   again sur   pied   .   The   Bishop   of   Carlisle   is   better .   Mr Montagu   who   calld   on   Ld   Lyttelton   this   morning found   him   in   sorrow ,   for   that   Lady   Anglesey   again had   miscarried .   There   seems   to   me   nothing tight   about   that   Lady ,   I   shd   expect   her   ever &   anon   to   drop   a   child   or   a   garter .   There   are people   who   have   no   tensities   or   tensions   or   tensitiosities     which you   please   &   all   moral   &   natural   matters   hang   loose   about them .   just   thus   poor   thing   she   droppd   one of   the   ten   Commandments ,   &   honourd   not   her Father ,   tho   in   all   respects   he   deserves   it ,   & if   he   had   not ,   the   command   had   deserved   it   for him .   I   have   not   time   to   describe   to   you   a   clock which   is   going   to   ye   East   Indies ,   it   exceeds   any thing   in   ye   Arabian   tales ,   take   with   you   this circumstance ;   Dragons   flap   their   Emerald   wings &   spit   pearls   every   second .   But   of   what   use   is such   a   clock ?   does   not   every   second ,   &   the   smallest division   of   time   pace   to   our   eternal   home ?   Does not   a   small   part   of   a   minute   suffice   to   do an   act   of   virtue ?   It   is   not   by   pearl   &   Diamond we   shd   measure   ye   value   of   time .   Hall   tells Falstaffe ,   that   if   hours   were   Capons ,   &   minutes were   Cups   of   sack ,   they   wd   be   worth   his Enquiry .   Nabobs   to   be   sure   considers   hours as   Diamonds ,   &   minutes   as   pearls ,   that   is they   value   it time   only   as   it   bring   Riches or   big   Wings .   I   wish   you   had   seen   this   peice of   oriental   Wealth   set   off   by   English   ingenuity &   art ,   it   was   indeed   a   wonderfull   peice .   Mr John   Pitt   esteems   ye   Workmanship   at     L ye   Materials   are   gold   pearl   gems   of   various   sort &   Diamonds .   for     years     men   were   employ d employ d   in   making   it .   I   have   just   this   moment heard   the   poor   Bishop   of   Carlisle   is   no   more .   Adieu   I   am fatigued   with   this   mornings   drawing   room   but well   in   health   &   always   most   affectly Yrs   E M I   did   not   mention   ye breaking   up   of   ye   society   at   Hitcham   because Mrs   Freind   desired   her   application   for   lodgings at   Windsor   Castle   might   be   a   secret .   She   thinks ye   System   too   expensive ,   but   wd   be   glad   if her   application   does   not   succeed   to   continue   in the   Society   in   a   smaller   House   upon   a life   establishment ,   but   between   you   &   I   that cannot   be ,   for   she   does   not   behave   tolerably to   Mrs   Cutts   to   whom   my   Sister   is   so   much obliged .   She   complains   Mrs   Cutts   is   not   humble enough ,   poor   Woman   she   is   so   unaffectedly   so that   she   makes   no   parade   of   her   humility . pray   mention   not   this   to   any   one .   I   found   poor Mrs   Cutts   was   not   happy   in   ye   summer   when I   calld   there . 
BC_1768_EMONTAGU_ED_1	Tuesday ,   ye     Dec   My   Dearest I   am   much   rejoyced   to   find   you endure   this   severe   weather   so   well .   Fareinheits Thermometer   was     degrees   below   freezing   point on   wen'sday   last .   I   can   endure   the   weather   tolerably well   when   I   sit   just   over   the   fire ,   but   it   renders me   almost   incapable   of   any   occupation   but reading   for   my   fingers   soon   become   numb ,   & I   ake   with   cold .   In   all   this   violence   of   weather the   Duke   of   Newcastle   is   recovering   of   a fever   &   inflammation   on   the   lungs ,   &   returns to   health   with   ye   same   rapidity   one   shd   expect of   one   in   the   meridian   of   life .   Ld   Chatham is   at   Hayes   &   is   about   taking   a   House   in Town ,   but   I   do   not   find   that   his   Creatures   have any   hope   of   his   returning   to   take   a   part   in business ,   for   ye   least   discourse   on   publick   affairs throws   him   into   strange   agitation .   I   dined yesterday   at   Bath   House .   Every   thing   was   in   the Same   state   as   in   Lord   Baths   time ;   handsome dinner ,   great   number   of   attendants   & c   and   as the   present   possessors   can   walk   up   &   down stairs   the   whole   House   was   well   illuminated , &   warm d   with   large   fires ,   &   had   more   the   air of   a   Gentlemans   House   in   the   Country   than of   a   Hotel   in   Town ;   upon   ye   modern   plan , as   two   or   three   rooms   are   all   one   usually passes   through .   What   you   say   of   the   state of   the   poor   is   too   true ,   their   case   is   perfectly wretched   in   such   a   Season   &   it   is   among the   duties   of   humanity   to   give   some   relief upon   occasions   of   this   kind .   As   ones   purse   is limited ,   it   is   right   to   make   what   one   can give   go   as   far   as   possible   in   serving   them , &   therefore   it   is   often   best   to   provide   them with   food ,   as   one   can   do   it   at   a   cheaper   rate than   they   can   do   for   themselves .   If   on   ye Market   day   my   friend   Woodhouse   wd   buy during   this   Season     pound   of   coarse   beef and   a   Sheeps   head   or   two   &   of   this   stock   four   Coppers of   broth   might   be   made ,   a   Copper   each   day for     days   in   ye   Week ,   the   broth   must   be   made savorery   with   onions   &   thicken'd   with pease   or   rice ,   all   ye   remnants   of   cold   meat &   senaps   &   crusts   of   bread   shd   be   put   into it ,   &   some   common   black   pepper   beaten . even   ye   liquer   bacon   has   been   boild   in may   be   mixd   with   it .   If   some   brown   bread was   baked   &   some   cut   into   their   broth it   wd   do   well .   Woodhouse   knows   how   to make   a   cheap   rice   pudding .   Thus one   poor   family   might   every   day   be served   at   a   small   charge   &   ye   quantity I   mention   wd   feed   them   for     days   adding only   their   bread   to   it .   Pottatoes   might   be bought   cheap   by   ye   bushel   &   a   quantity boild   &   mashed   &   then   put   under   roasting   meat to   catch   ye   dripping   wd   make   a   good pudding .   Mr   Woodhouse   will   find   many ways   to   feed   ye   poor   Creatures   at   a   reasonable rate   which   will   make   yr   kindness   ye farther .   To   very   old   people   some   coarse warm   wrapping   is   perhaps   ye   highest charity .   As   you   seem   desirous   to   relieve ye   poor   you   may   tell   Woodhouse   what you   wd   give   &   he   &   Daphne   will   manage notably .   I   hope   yr   rheumatism   will   not increase   as   it   is   a   painfull   companion . My   cold   is   better   a   great   deal .   Poor   Lord Lyttelton   continues   much   indisposed   & confined   to   his   House .   Several   people   are indisposed   with   the   severity   of   ye   weather . Pray   remember   me   to   Mr   Woodhouse &   Daphne :   With   great   esteem   &   all   good   wishes I   am   my   Dear yr   most   affectionate and   faithfull   Wife E M 
BC_1768_EMONTAGU_ED_2	ye     of   Ap:   My   Dearest I   had   a   very   safe   journey   hither   but not   a   very   pleasant   one   as   the   weather   proved   very untoward .   Yesterday   morning   made   amends   the   air being   soft   &   fine .   I   found   my   Sister   very   well   &   I hope   that   she   will   enjoy   more   health   here   than   she did   at   the   Bath ,   where   the   Town   is   close   &   her habitation   was   small .   The   rooms   here   are   large   & airy ,   the   soil   dry ,   &   the   Sun   enlivens   all   the   rooms that   are   inhabited .   The   House   does   not   command any   prospect ,   but   as   the   winter   months   are   many in   this   climate ,   it   is   perhaps   better   for   a   Person constantly   resident   in   the   Country ,   to   lose   some Summer   delights   to   have   the   rigor   of   winter   mitigated . There   is   a   vast   deal   of   fruit ,   and   a   large   good garden   for   legumes .   The   chambers   are   large   &   chearfull . The   Hall   is   magnificent ,   but   magnificence is   not   wanted .   upon   the   whole   I   think   my Sister   will   pass   her   time   more   agreably   here   than she   did   at   Bath .   for   a   retired   life   in   a   Town   is   a sort   of   imprisonment .   I   am   very   solicitous   to   hear how   you   are   in   your   health .   I   think   an   airing yesterday   must   have   been   more   beneficial   than any   medicine ;   the   air   was   so   balsamick ;   &   the   musick of   the   birds ,   &   the   early   verdure ,   give   this   season a   softness   &   sweetness   that   is   more   pleasing   than any   thing   the   other   parts   of   ye   year   can   boast of .   The   Summer   is   too   fervent ,   the   autumn ,   as   it   is the   decline   of   the   year   inspires   one   with   melancholy but   spring   like   the   hopes   of   youth   delights   & chears   the   heart   with   views   of   succeeding   pleasures &   joys   to   come .   My   Sister   wishes   you   would   come to   Hitcham ,   that   she   might   endeavour   to return   the   kind   attentions   you   paid   to   her at   Sandleford ,   of   which   she   has   a   pleasing   & gratefull   remembrance .   I   shall   return   to   you on   saturday   to   dinner ,   however   beg   of   you   not to   wait   beyond   four ,   as   little   accidents   may make   one   an   hour   later   than   the   time   proposed I   hope   Mr   Wilkes   &   his   friends   were   not   thrown into   any   state   of   violence   yesterday . My   Sister   &   Miss   Arnold   desire   their   most affectionate   compliments .   It   will   be   great   joy   to me   to   find   you   in   better   health   than   I   left   you . I   beg   of   you   to   be   carefull   of   your   health   for the   sake   of   my   Dearest Your   most   gratefull   affectionate and   Faithfull   Wife E:   Montagu I   am   going   to   take   the   air &   shall   have   double   delight in   the   soft   western   breeze   from   thinking   you are   inhaling   so   much   balsam   into   yr   lungs .   I believe   it   much   better   for   them   than   ye Doctors   balsamick   mixtures ,   indeed   he   is honest   enough   to   own   as   much . 
BC_1768_EMONTAGU_ED_3	Thursday   ye   My   Dearest That   this   may   find   you   improved and   improving   in   health   is   my   most   earnest wish !   I   got   safe   &   well   to   this   Town ,   which has   been   in   a   wonderfull   ferment   &   I   fear is   not   likely   soon   to   settle   into   good   order &   Tranquillity .   The   Judges   desired   time   to search   into   their   books   before   they   determined on   Mr   Wilkes's   affair   so   it   will   be   undeided till   next   term   in   the   mean   time   he is   a   head   to   all   ye   ill   humours   of   the State   &   great   gathering   of   ill   humours appears .   The   Sailors   have   been   very   violent two   of   them   were   admitted   to   ye   Kings presence   he   told   them   he   had   no   authority to   interpose   as   to   their   affair   so   they   walkd off   quietly   but   he   cannot   answer   in   like manner   to   Mr   Wilkes's   mob   for   it   is in   his   power   to   pardon .   If   the   outlawry   shd be   determined   good   &   legal   the   poor   man will   be   Prisoner   for   life   a   hard   sentence upon   him ,   &   a   dangerous   one   to   ye   Governmt The   D:   of   G-n ,   once   his   Patron   &   abetter , is   turn d   furiously   against   him ,   &   made a   flaming   speech   on   ye   subject   of   ye   libels in   ye   House   of   Lords   ye   other   day .   The   Mob follow'd   Ld   Spencers   coach   ye   other   day , crying ,   a   Spencer   &   no   Hallifax .   Ld   Weymouth is   thought   to   urge   on   ye   measures   against Wilkes   to   make   himself   agreable   to   the C- .   The   temper   of   a   Court   is   best   judged of   by   ye   sentiments   professd   by   such   as are   desirous   to   make   themselves   favorites Wilkes   has   ye   stranguary   in   a   terrible manner   &   is   in   very   bad   health .   It   is   said that   Ld   Chatham   being   ask d   what   he thought   advisable   in   regard   to   Wilkes answerd   vigour   without   rigour .   He   loves ye   darkness   of   Oracular   sentences .   I   imagine a   certain   great   friend   of   Wilkes   will   struggle hard   for   him   if   the   sentence   shd   be   hard severe .   Most   people   think   there   is   an   intention beyond   vigour   even   to   rigour   but   all   this   is but   conjecture ,   for   either   the   Ministry   is very   secret   or   what   is   more   probable ,   they are   undetermined .   Little   Matt   has   had   a fever   but   was   getting   better   when   he   was at   Hitcham .   My   Brr   was   much   pleased with   ye   place .   My   Sister   was   ill   in   bed with   a   violent   headach   when   I   went   &   was   quite   unable   to   speak ,   so   I   had little   of   her   company .   The   Town   is   very disagreable .   I   sent   this   morning   to   desire Mr   Wilson   to   call   on   me   tomorrow or   ye   first   leisure   time   he   had .   I   am impatient   to   get   my   business   done   that I   may   return   to   my   dear   Worthy   Husband &   to   tranquillity   &   rural   pleasure .   I   hope a   week   will   finish   all   my   business . My   Father   &   Bror   Charles   desire   their Compts .   I   am   my   dearest   with   ye   highest esteem   &   most   tender   affection Entirely   &   faithfully yrs   E M 
BC_1768_EMONTAGU_ED_4	ye   My   Dearest I   am   just   come   from   visiting Lady   Strathmore   &   her   bambino .   I   dined   at   my   Broth Fathers   where   I   found   my   Bror   William   &   his Wife   they   came   yesterday   she   was   with   me yesterday   evening   but   the   Divine   was   too lazy   to   come   out .   They   go   to   Burfield   or   rather to   the   Crown   at   Reading   to   reside   from   Saturday till   tuesday .   On   tuesday   they   will   come   with me   to   Sandleford   &   stay   till   friday   unless they   shd   be   obliged   to   return   to   London   directly about   their   Law   affairs .   I   am   of   yr   opinion   that the   Parliamt   seems   disposed   to   act   with rigour   as   well   as   vigour ,   but   the   rigour will   be   ill   timed   &   end   in   disgrace   or   in confusion .   My   Father   &   Bror   Morris   at   dinner said   they   heard   Mr   Lyttelton   had   spoke   admirably well   in   the   H:   of   Commons   yesterday   which will   make   his   Father   very   happy .   The young   man   has   excellent   parts   &   great   vivacity , a   turn   to   business   will   keep   him   out   of idle   pleasures   &   may   call   forth   ye   good qualities   which   his   infancy   promised . I   am   sorry   yr   letter   yesterday   had   no   better account   to   give   me   of   yr   health .   I   will   bring all   the   papers   &   shall   better   explain   by word   of   mouth   every   thing   relative   to ye   Lease   with   ye   shafte's   than   I   can   do by   letter .   Mr   Wilson   paid   Sr   Sydney   all that   was   due   for   interest   &   Mr   Woodcock allows   it   &   so   does   Sr   Sidney   it   is   only last   years   Colly   rent   that   is   due   &   one year   due   only     days   ago .   Mr   Wilson   shewd me   ye   account   &   it   is   plain   you   paid   years   interest   last   year .   My   Bror   Williams children   have   ye   hooping   cough .   Morris   &   his Wife   are   much   pleased   that   I   take   ye little   Matt   down   &   ye   Childs   behaviour   upon it   is   ye   prettiest   imaginable   so   pleased   to   go &   yet   saying   he   wishes   Papa   &   Mama   wd come   &   dine   with   him   sometimes .   A   motion was   made   by   a   young   Man   in   ye   House   to   desire   ye proper   officer   of   ye   Crown   to   lay   before   ye House   of   Commons   why   Mr   Wilkes   ye Outlaw   was   not   taken   up   on   his   coming   to England .   Mr   Lyttelton   gave   reasons   why that   motion   cd   not   be   complied   with   in a   manner   that   gave   great   satisfaction   to all   parties ,   &   he   was   universally   applauded . I   beg   the   favour   of   you   to   let   a   pair   of   horses wait   for   me   at   the   Crown   at   Reading   on   tuesday if   they   are   at   Reading   by     o'clock   they   will be   ready   to   take   me   up   at   one   by   which hour   I   hope   to   be   there ,   &   with   you   by   four . I   expect   Mr   Wilson   tomorrow   &   Sr   Sydney   on   saturday . My   being   much   indisposed   at   first   coming to   Town   put   me   back   into   my   business   thank God   I   am   pure   well   now .   No   one   yet   knows what   will   yet   be   ye   fate   of   Wilkes ,   it it   is   surmized   ye   outlawry   will   be   confirmd . I   heartily   wish   I   may   find   you   better   for the   little   amendment   we   have   in   ye   weather . Your   health   was   drunk   with   great   zeal at   my   Fathers .   With   ye   highest   &   most   tender affection I   am   my   Dearest Yr   most   faithfull and   affect:   Wife E M a   thousand   thanks   for ye   fine   trout   &   Cray   fish 
BC_1768_EMONTAGU_ED_5	ye     Aug. My   Dearest   &   best   Friend As   john   will   be   at   Sandleford   soon after   the   post   it   may   seem   unreasonable   to trouble   you   with   a   letter ,   &   spend   ye   unnecessary three   pence ;   however   I   will   indulge   myself   in just   writing   you   a   line ,   &   let   my   other   letter travel   by   ye   Machine   with   john   .   Mr   Stewart   who   calld here   from   Ealing ,   says   our   little   Courayer   walkd from   thence   to   Mr   Shutz's   and   back   that   night , ye   walk   not   much   less   going   &   coming   than   miles ,   being   told   it   was   a   long   walk   &   he laughd   &   said   so   it   was   but   he   had   a   mind to   see   whether     cd   do   what     had done   ye   summer   before .   Is   he   not   a   fine   old Buck ?   My   Father   seemd   pleased   with   ye little   stories   I   told   him   of   Matts   witt   &   drollery . I   hope   the   Buck   came   good .   Mr   Stillingfleet and   Mr   Black   eat   part   of   ye   neck   of   venison with   me   to   day .   My   Sister   &   I   are   to   dine   at my   Fathers   to   morrow .   I   have   sent   to   night to   know   whether   my   Bror   Morris   comes   to Town   to   morrow   as   was   expected . I   have   letters   from   Northumberland   that they   have   fine   weather   &   a   great   crop   of corn .   Mr   Archdeacon   has   got   ye   vouchers   for ye   Mill   &   bakehouse   repairs .   The   King   of Denmarks   being   so   ill   he   cannot   go   to   York Races   will   be   a   disappointment   to   the   people in   that   part   of   ye   World .   I   intend   to   be   with you   on   sunday   unless   Mr   King   does   not   come to   Town   tomorrow   he   is   expected   to   morrow   or next   day .   I   will   write   by   ye   Machine   which will   be   at   Newbury   on   saturday   if   I   dont   come till   monday   but   if   you   dont   hear   further ,   please to   send   me   a   pair   of   horses   to   ye   crown   at Reading   on   sunday .   My   tenderest   wishes   ever   attend you ,   wait   you   every   hour   &   would   to   God   health was   as   constantly   in   attendance   upon   you   as the   tender   &   gratefull   love   of   your   Faithfull   affectte   and Obedt   Wife E Montagu Mr   Black   will   be   with   you   on   sunday   or   monday without   fail 
BC_1768_EMONTAGU_EV_1	Hillstreet   feb   ye     My   good   Friend   Mrs   Carter   wd acquaint   my   Dear   Sylph   why   I   have   been   such an   idle   correspondent .   I   am   now   under   Sr   John Pringles   care   &   I   hope   he   will   bring   my   teeth &   jaws   into   better   humour ,   at   present   writing is   very   painfull   &   very   hurtfull   in   its   consequences The   Duchess   of   Montagu   is   come   to   Town much   mended   by   the   Bath   waters .   The   Duchess of   Buccleugh   has   ye   proper   sloping   kind   of shape ,   which   promises   great   joy   to   the   noble family ,   &   in   a   short   time .   Lady   Primrose is   much   better   than   at   the   beginning   of the   winter ,   &   Mrs   Carter ,   tho   she   had   a   bad summer ,   is   now   as   well   as   ever   I   saw her ;   too   much   mauvaise   honte   &   too   much headach   still ,   in   all   other   respects   as   one   could wish .   Lady   Anne   Dawson   seems   placid   &   to wear   her   afflictions   with   angelick   patience I   sent   yr   letter   to   Brampton   where   she   lodges Yesterday   Hymen   join d   the   hands   ( Cupid   before   had united   the   hearts )   of   Sr   Geo   Macartney   &   Lady Jane   Stewart .   A   great   deal   of   merit   on   both sides   promises   mutual   happiness ,   &   tho   he   has not   a   great   estate   his   talents   &   her   Friends are   great   enough   to   procure   whatever   they can   wish .   Our   Friend   Burke   speaks   better &   better ,   but   his   Patron   is   not   likely   to   be first   Minister .   Lord   Bute   is   in   a   very   bad state   of   health ,   eats   only   vegetables .   Lord Bristol   is   grown   a   perfect   Hercules ,   &   looks as   if   he   lived   on   ye   roast   beef   of   Old   England . Lady   Hervey   is   very   well .   Lord   Lyttelton   is extreamly   well ,   &   seems   to   live   &   thrive ,   but his   History   will   survive   him   many Centurys .   the   little   opposition   envy   made   to ye   history   at   first   is   subdued ,   &   it   is   the   fashion to   admire   it ,   many   admire   it   who   I   believe cannot   give   any   other   reason .   Mrs   Dunbar   & Mrs   J   Pitt   are   well .   Mrs   Anne   Pitt   is   going to   sell   leave   her   House   in   Berkely   Square   to live   at   Kensington .   Lady   Louisa   Clayton   is very   happy   in   her   new   state ,   &   finds   more felicity   in   retirement   than   she   did   at   Court . Mr   Montagu   passd   ye   Xmass   at   Sandleford , I   with   the   blue   stocking   philosophers .   I   had parties   of   them   to   dine   with   me   continually , &   had   my   Sylph   been   of   ye   party ,   nothing had   been   wanting .   I   have   got   a   new   blue   stocking with   whom   I   am   much   pleased ,   a   Mr   Percy who   publish'd   ye   fragments Reliques   of   ye   ancient Poetry ,   he   is   a   very   ingenious   man ,   has   many anecdotes   of   Ancient   days ,   historical   as well   as   Poetical .   Mr   Walpoles   Historick   doubts came   out   yesterday .   I   have   read   about   half the   book ,   &   have   not   yet   either   learnt   or unlearnt   any   thing .   I   think   this   work   appears plainly   rather   of   ye   growth   of   Strawberry   Hill   than of   the   Forked   Hill .   I   do   not   mean   that   ye   work is   not   amusing   . ,   By by   the   courtesy   of   modern Parnassus   one   is   just   soothd   &   pleased   without being   delighted   or   instructed .   I   am   glad   your gentleness   was   able   to   endure   the   rude   frost we   had   this   Xmass ,   it   was   horrible   here . The   Great   Earl ,   erst   the   great   Commoner ,   always the   great   Pensioner ,   has   had   ye   gout   in   his foot ,   but   it   had   not   ye   good   effect   on   his spirits   that   was   hoped .   The   D:   of   Bedford has   recoverd   his   sight   ( I   mean   his   corporeal   vision ) so   as   to   discern   faces   ,   to   discern   minds   is a   more   difficult   talent .   This   Kingdom   is   all in   bustle   &   confusion   about   Elections ,   &   every Lady   will   be   leaving   London   early   in   the Spring .   The   young   Duchess   of   Portland   is likely   to   encrease   the   noble   family .   The Dowager   Duchess   is   very   well .   I   have   made my   letter   a   perfect   gazetteer .   The   next   I   write , &   I   hope   to   write   soon   shall   be   mes   pensees but   I   thought   you   seem'd   desirous   of   knowing the   state   of   our   World .   I   shall   not   think   our World   well   constituted   till   the   blue   room   is   again open .   My   best   compts   attend   Mr   Vesey   &   Mrs Handcock .

BC_1768_EMONTAGU_EV_2	Sandleford   june   ye     My   Dear   Madam Tho   I   have   often   the   honour   of   meeting Mr   Walpole   at   Lady   Herveys ,   I   will   not   suffer   him , to   infuse   into   my   mind   any   historic   doubts   concerning the   relation   you   give   of   Lady   Moyra's   entertainment I   will   only   beg   leave   to   say ,   that   every   thing   is embellish'd   by   your   pen .   Your   cabalistical   characters do   not   only   differ   in   form ,   but   in   power ,   from common   letters .   With   the   help   of   a ,   b ,   c ,   & c ,   many can   contrive   to   convey   to   a   distant   friend some   imperfect   idea   of   what   they   have   seen   or   heard , but   to   give   such   glowing   colours ,   &   lively   touches belongs   only   to   my   Dear   friends   scatterd   characters . They   certainly   contain   the   virtues   of   hieroglyphicks &   letters ,   paint   images ,   &   convey   spirit   with   ye united   power   of   both .   for   sensible   objects   they   have the   hieroglyphical   art ,   for   witt   the   brevity   of alphabetick   marks ,   in   one   respect   they   savour   of ye   Chinese   characters ,   which   is ,   that   one   must bestow   a   good   deal   of   time   to   learn   them   perfectly . I   have   long   attain d   to   an   entire   knowledge   of them ,   &   never   was   any   of   Lettré   so   well   paid for   their   trouble   by   reading   the   works   of Confucius ,   as   I   was   by   the   Memoirs   of   the Countess   of   Desmond .   I   realy   never   heard   of   so well   imagined   an   entertainment ,   &   think   it must   have   given   great   pleasure   to   those who   had   the   good   fortune   to   be   of   the   party . There   was   some   rumour   of   a   Masquerade to   have   been   at   Almacks ,   but   I   am   sure   we should   have   fallen   sadly   short   of   your   Masked ball .   I   found   the   Ladies   had   no   other   view but   to   dress   so   as   to   look   the   handsomest they   could ,   all   were   determined   to   be   beautifull , the   great   error   of   the   female   Sex ,   few   can   accomplish this   point ,   those   who   cannot ,   might   like   your Ladies   by   assuming   a   character   please   through Life ,   &   rival   even   the   Beauties   of   the   age   they   live in .   Nay   could   they   carry   into   real   Old   age   the witt ,   the   politeness ,   &   the   charms   of   the   Countess of   Desmond ,   they   would   prolong   their   reign   beyond the   limits   of   the   Lease   for     years   which   she   was oblige   to   sue   to   have   renewed .   It   is   now   fit   I should   give   you   some   reason   why   I   have   not answerd   yr   letter .   I   met   it   upon   my   table   in Hillstreet   at   my   return   to   London ,   I   had   been in   Berkshire   a   few   days   to   attend   Mr   Montagu , who   went   earlier   into   the   Country   than   usual , in   hopes   change   of   air   might   mitigate   a terrible   cough   which   has   persecuted   him ever   since   Xmass .   On   account   of   some   business I   went   to   Town ,   &   was   most   agreably   greeted by   yr   letter ,   which   came   I   suppose   only   ye day   before   me .   I   was   very   ill   in   Town   for   a few   days ,   &   much   hurried   to   get   my   business dispatched ,   that   I   might   return   back   to Mr   Montagu .   I   was   no   sooner   settled   here   than my   third   Brother   &   his   Wife   came   &   made a   visit   for   some   days ,   &   my   attendance   on Mr   Montagu   who   is   still   very   infirm ,   &   the multitude   of   letters   I   am   obliged   to   write   upon business ,   have   deprived   me   of   the   quiet   leisure which   makes   the   luxury   of   writing   to   a   Friend . I   suppose   your   letters   from   England   are   full   of Mr   Wilkes .   I   am   so   tired   of   his   name ,   that   should I   play   in   some   Gothick   Mansion   at   Christmass Games   I   shall   never   lose   my   love   with   a   W   .   I   will tell   you   a   conundrum   of   Lord   Tyrawley   because I   think   he   is   a   Friend   of   yours .   He   said   at   the first   of   Mr   Wilkes   appearance   the   Ministry were   Pusillanimous ,   &   now   they   are   puzzle   animous I   know   not   what   scrapes   their   puzzilanimity may   bring   us   into .   Lord   Holland   is   come   over in   high   health   &   spirits ,   &   some   say   is   to   seize the   too   slacken'd   reins   of   Government ,   but   the great   beast   will   kick   &   wince   under   a   Rider who   it   thinks   will   whip   &   spur   through   dirty roads .   Now   you   want   to   know   what   Lord   Chatham will   do ,   ask   not   me ,   consult   some   oracle   dark &   ambiguous   as   himself ,   or   perhaps   you   had   better still   consult   his   nurse   or   his   apothecary .   Whether his   High   Mightiness   will   call   for   the   blood   of Wilkes ,   or   for   a   Mess   of   water   gruel   on   this   exigency is   more   than   I   can   determine ,   I   know   it   will be   one   or   the   other .   He   has   hitherto   turn d   his Woolsack   into   a   pillow ,   &   I   believe   he   will   reclines   upon it   while   there   are   such   storms   &   tempests   abroad . He   has   sold   greatest   part   of   the   Pynsent   estate ,   but I   hope   will   always   keep   as   much   of   the   Land   as will   serve   for   the   Basis   of   his   Column   of   gratitude   to his   Wise   &   virtuous   benefactor .   Many   men   retain the   gift   &   lose   ye   gratitude ,   his   great   Soul will   do   the   reverse .   Mrs   Ann   Pitt   has   parted   with the   House   in   Berkely   Square ,   &   retires   to   her   Villa . I   am   sure   you   will   be   glad   to   hear   that   Mr   Lyttelton spoke   extreamly   well   in   the   House   of   Commons . Mr   Burke   told   me   the   performance   was   in   every respect   such   as   to   do   him   honour ,   &   to   give   pleasure to   his   Father   He   having   not   only   spoken   with sense ,   &   eloquence ,   but   with   modesty ,   and discretion ;   qualities   that   have   not   shone forth   in   all   occasions ,   but   indeed   he   is   the most   improved   I   ever   saw   any   young   Man . Lord   &   Lady   Anglesey   are   quite   what   the   good folks   call   a   fond   couple .   Have   I   written   so many   lines   &   have   yet   askd   my   Sylph   when she   comes   to   England ?   My   heart   enquires   after this   every   moment .   I   hope   Lady   Ann   Dawson &   Mr   Dawson   will   bring   you   over   with   them in   the   Autumn   at   which   time   they   promised to   return   to   us .   I   am   charmed   with   that   pair . Lady   Ann   is   Miltons   divine   melancholly , She   is   the   Goddess   Sage   &   holy .   I   like   Mr   Dawson extreamly ,   but   wd   not   have   Mr   Vesey   uneasy at   that ,   for   he   is   too   young   to   be   a   dangerous Rival .   I   see   no   other   fault   the   man   has .   He has   a   great   deal   of   sense ,   goodness ,   &   the   easy dignity   of   a   Gentleman   in   his   manner . When   I   left   London ,   Count   Zintzendorffe   one of   les   grands   Chambellans   de   l'Empire   & a   Monsieur   Dangueil ,   a   very   lively   clever french   man ,   talk'd   of   visiting   Ireland .   I   beg if   they   come   to   Dublin   you   wd   take   some   notice of   them ,   &   say   it   is   for   my   sake .   You   know I   love   to   give   myself   consequence   with   Foreigners &   I   am   sure   you   will   be   pleased   with   both these   Gentlemen .   I   had   a   letter   from   Ld   Lyttelton about   ten   days   ago ,   in   which   he   said   he   shd probably   leave   London   this   week .   He   is   going to   Hagley .   Our   Friend   Mr   Burke   is   acquiring fame   every   day .   He   has   purchased   a   House   near   Beaconsfield ,   a   very   elegant   place . Mrs   Carter   is   just   gone   back   to   her   Household   Gods at   Deal .   I   hope   she   will   enjoy   her   health   better than   she   did   last   summer .   She   look d   very   well when   I   left   London ,   but   her   constitution   is much   as   it   used   to   be .   Pray   what   reason   do you   assign   at   Dublin   for   Ld   Gowers   marrying Lady   Susan   Stewart .   We   have   not   found   it out   at   London ,   but   I   suppose   it   was   discoverd at   Lady   Moiyra's   Ball .   Was   it   that   Stewart is   a   good   name   to   conjure   with ?   By   the   by   I approve   much   of   Lady   Jane   Stewarts   choice of   Sr   Geo:   Macartney .   I   believe   they   will   be   very happy   which   is   better   than   being   very   rich . Pray   how   is   my   Friend   Mr   Jeptison ?   I   hope   he intends   to   come   to   England   with   Ld   Townshend . My   paper   is   almost   as   full   as   it   will   hold ,   &   Mr Montagu   not   being   now   in   Parliamt   I   dare   not hazard   yr   paying   for   a   treble   letter ,   &   I   am   not   sure of   getting   a   frank .   I   have   utterly   forgot   ye   name   of   yr Street   at   Dublin   &   must   send   this   to   be   directed   to   Mrs   Carter . I   beg   my   compts   to   Mr   Vesey   &   Mrs   Handcock .   I   am   Dr   Madm Ever   yrs   E Montagu 
BC_1768_EMONTAGU_EV_3	Sandleford   Oct   ye   Great   was   the   pleasure   I   received   from my   Dear   Mrs   Vesey   letter   it   found   me   in   Berkshire sitting   by   the   Summer   fire   ,   which   has   none   of   the joys   of   the   winters   fire ,   round   which   ones   friends are   assembled   just &   pans   crackle ,   &   ye   petit   mot plaisire   sposh   about   in   joyous   circle .   As   dull   as the   gravest ,   as   serious   as   the   wisest   philosopher ,   has l'ame   du   monde   le   moins   philosophique   pass'd there   last   five   months ,   under   the   shades   of   melancholly boughs   drooping   with   continual   rain .   It is   true   I   made   two   trips   to   London   since ,   ye   beginning of   May ,   but   I   staid   merely   long   enough to   dispatch   ye   business   that   carried   me   thither , &   return'd   to   nurse   Mr   Montagu ,   who   has   been a   perfect   invalid   for   many   months .   If   the   Rooks talk d   as   you   talk   for   them ,   I   could   not   advise you   to   leave   them   even   for   birds   of   Paradise , but   as   naturaly   they   have   not   le   bon   ton   ,   pray come   away   to   London .   We   propose   to   repair   to that   Noble   Metropolis   the   end   of   this   month , &   I   am   impatient   to   enjoy   the   delights   of   the blue   room .   I   lament ,   for   my   Foreign   Friends , that   they   had   the   misfortune   not   to   be   introduced to   you   &   Mr   Vesey ,   &   I   lament   for   myself ,   that I   had   not   the   honour   of   conferring   so   great an   obligation   upon   them .   Mrs   Carter   has   informd you   that   she   was   long   engaged   in   consoling   the   melancholly family   at   Lambeth .   Your   Friend   Mr   Burke has   bought   a   pretty   House   &   estate   at   Beaconsfield . Lord   Lyttelton   has   been   all   the   Summer   at   Hagley , it   is   almost   two   months   since   I   heard   from   him , but   he   was   then   very   well .   I   attribute   his   silence to   his   respect   to   Henry   ye   ,   &   his   Love   to   Fair Rosamund .   Lord   &   Lady   Anglesea   are   the   fondest of   Turtles ,   which   makes   Lord   Lyttelton ,   who   remembers his   own   happy   days   of   Turtleism   very   happy . But   I   dont   believe   the   Turtle   feast   of   the noble   pair   above   mention'd   to   be   made   of   such elegant   ingredients   as   my   good   Lords   &   his   Fair Lucy ,   however   it   is   still   Turtle .   Mr   Stillingfleet   is gone   to   Bath   in   a   very   good   state   of   health .   I think   the   rest   of   our   Friends   are   pretty   well .   Dr Monsey   has   lately   done   a   thing   worthy   of himself ,   &   which   both   in   itself ,   &   from   the   greatness of   the   Dramatis   Personae   ,   may   be   call'd   High Comedy .   The   King   of   Denmark ,   who   came   out of   his   own   Country   to   see   Citties   &   men ,   has not   seen   such   a another   man ,   or   such   a another   sight   as   the great   Monsey ,   &   the   great   Monseys   bedchamber . His   Danish   Majesty   went   to   visit   Chelsea   College , &   the   Doctor   there   explaind   to   him   a   mathematical Instrument   of   singular   construction ,   but   afterwards , I   know   not   how ,   nor   why ,   he   carried   his   Majesty   &   his   into   his   own   Bedchamber .   The   condition   of   the Atmosphere   was   such ,   as   to   make   them   all   look about   them ;   the   first   object   that   presented   itself was   a   certain   Vessel   which   the   Potter   having   fashiond to   dishonour ,   is   usualy   conceal'd   under   a   Bed . on   the   table   lay   an   old   periwig ,   which   lookd as   if   it   had   been   the   scalp   of   Tysiphone ;   on a   chair ,   with   the   bellows   for   its   companion ,   a rusty   black   wastecoat ,   dirty   stocks ,   stray   stockings ,   foul handerkerchiefs ,   in   beautifull   negligence   were scatterd   round   the   floor ;   but   worst   of   worst , was   a   bason   of   water   in   which   the   Doctor ,   to put   himself   to   appear   before   his   Royal   Guest ,   had wash'd   his   face   &   hands   that   morning .   The unamiable   &   black   Cocytus   could   not   have   furnish'd a   liquid   of   such   sad   hue .   It   was   dyed   by   the   fogs of   many   Novembers ,   &   the   perspiration   of   the   dog days ,   black   with   the   winters   smoke ,   embrownd with   the   dust   of   the   Summers   journeys ,   in   short it   was   the   foul   collection   of   the   revolving   Seasons &   various   accidents   of   half   a   Century ,   for   till   that day ,   that   fatal   day ,   since   he   received   infant baptism   never   had   his   face   known   the   touch of   water .   You   may   imagine   the   Royal   Dane , like   his   Predecessor   Prince   Hamlet ,   in   dire   amazement recoiling   cry'd ,   angels   &   ministers   of   Grace   defend   us ! &   question d   much   of   the   airs   &   blasts   that   saluted his   Royal   nostrils .   I   am   sure   Mrs   Handcock ,   who is   all   neatness ,   will   hold   her   nose   at   this narration ,   but   as   it   concern'd   such   extraordinary things   as   a   King   &   a   prodigy ,   I   could   not help   communicating   it .   I   wish   some   of   the Doctors   jocose   Friends   had   put   it   into   the news ,   that   he   was   going   to   Denmark   with his   Majesty   in   the   double   capacity   of   Fou &   physician .   I   believe   the   Northern   coasts still   keep   un   fou   en   titre   d'office   ,   I   know   no one   so   well   qualified   for   the   post   as   our   Doctor , who   has   the   largest   portion   of   witt   &   jolly ,   parts &   absurdity ,   of   any   man   that   ever   existed . Pray   when   will   Lady   Anne   Dawson   return to   us ?   Mr   Dawson   &   she   will   adorn   even   the   Room .   I   had   tickets   offer d   me   for   the grand   Masquerade ,   but   I   did   not   care   to   leave Mr   Montagu   as   he   was   in   precarious   health for   this   last   fortnight   his   cough   has   much abated ,   &   he   seems   on   the   recovery ,   but   winter is   always   pernicious   to   him .   I   have   had   my pretty   little   nephew   with   me   all   the   Summer . it   is   the   most   joyous   animal   that   ever   lived , &   has   a   wonderfull   share   of   sense .   Last   night   I had   a   note   from   Mr   &   Mrs   Pulteney   who   were going   to   Bath ,   she   is   not   well ,   which   I   am sure   you   will   be   sorry   for ,   as   they   have   shewn so   much   regard   to   Mrs   Carter .   It   is     ages since   I   have   heard   of   the   great   Wilkes ,   or   the late   great   Commoner ,   or   any   thing   of   Patriots past   or   present ,   or   future   Ministers .   Mrs   Delany is   at   Bulstrode   with   the   Duchess   of   Portland who   has   been   out   of   health .   Lord   Edwd   Bentinck is   ill .   Lady   Weymorth   is   soon   to   lye   in ,   Lady Shelburne   &   her   new   born   son   thank   God   are very   well .   You   need   not   fear   my   Dear   Friend that   I   should   make   free   with   your   letters ; sooner   wd   an   Epicures   Alderman   give   to   his Clerks   &   apprentices   Callipash   &   Callipee ,   than I   would ,   to   vulgar   taste ,   offer   ye   divine   letters . I   am   truly   sorry   Count   Zinzendorffe   &   Mr Dangeau   did   not   see   you   one   Canto   of   the   Sylpheid wd   have   been   more   worth   than   their   whole   Epick Poem .   I   am   sure   you   grieved   at   the   death of   Lady   Hervey ,   no   one   ever   surely   understood the   difficult   art ,   de   viellir   de   bonne   grace   so well .   So   much   chearfulness   without   levity , always   in   Society ,   never   in   a   Croud . As   soon   as   you   fix   your   return   to   London let   me   have   the   pleasure   of   knowing   it   .   I   love to   have   a   date   to   my   hopes .   Pray   tell   Mr Vesey   not   to   be   jealous   of   Count   Zinzendorffe , for   he   is   above     years   short   of   the   seducing   age I   believe   it   will   be     years   before   even   his french   companion   grows   dangerous ,   in   less   time Mr   Vesey   &   I   may   bring   our   Romance   to   a   conclusion , &   yet   make   it   as   voluminously   respectable as   the   Grand   Cyrus .   You   may   tell   him   now   that I   dont   hate   him   ,   which   is   more   than   Mandane wd   have   said   before   her   Lover   had   served   her twenty   years ,   &   conquerd   as   many   Kingdoms for   her   sake ,   but   there   is   no   keeping   ones   dignity in   these   modern   days .   Pray   are   not   you   rejoyced that   Mr   Gray   has   got   a   peice   of   preferment   worth L   pr   ann. ?   I   wish   you   may   bring   Mr   Jeptison to   England .   I   remember   with   great   pleasure   the agreable   hours   I   pass d   in   his   company . My   love   &   respects   to   Mrs   Hancock .   I   have   already sent   my   love   to   Mr   Vesey   under   a   proper   veil . I   am   my   Dear   Madam   with   most   sincere &   tender   affection Yours E Montagu 
BC_1768_EMONTAGU_EV_4	Dear   Madam Welcome   &   thrice   welcome   to   our   Land !   I   have sufferd   much   apprehension   for   my   Sylph   tho it   seems   to   me   as   if   she   was   made   to   live &   to   charm   in   all   elements ,   yet   I   was   afraid   of ye   Ocean   &   if   the   stable   Earth   by   rains   has lost   some   of   her   trusty   firmness .   I   wd   have   braved the   malignant   gloom   of   ye   day ,   &   have   calld on   you   instead   of   sending   a   note ,   but   I   imagine you   are   not   to   be   found   at   home .   I   shall   be at   home   this   whole   day   nursing   the   headach , unless   you   tempt   me   to   yr   enchanted   &   enchanting fairy   Castle .   I   am   sorry   Mrs   Hancock   has   been ill ,   &   that   you   have   taken   a   violent   medicine to   make   you   so .   I   beg   to   know   how   you   both   do . May   I   flatter   my   propensity   to   a   passion for   Mr   Vesey   with   the   hope   of   finding   more autumnal   Graces   about   him ?   My   compts wait   on   you   all   &   I   am   glad   we   are   now   within the   sphere   of   visits   &   twisted   notes .   Dear   Madm Ever   yrs E M 
BC_1768_EMONTAGU_MA	Denton   Dec:   ye     My   dear   Sister I   cannot   help   wishing   you   &   my   Brother   joy ,   on   a circumstance   which   gives   me   a   great   deal .   I   am   sorry   this happy   event   must   be   purchased   by   some   hours   of   pain ,   but   hope they   will   be   few ,   before   you   forget   them   in   the   joy ,   that   a man   child   is   born   into   the   World   ,   however   if   it   should   be   a female   infant ,   we   will   most   joyfully   receive   it ,   for   it   will lay   a   broader   foundation   of   happiness   for   you   &   of   pleasure   to us ,   than   the   dependance   on   one   little   Damsel ,   &   it   will   give her   a   better   chance   to   have   her   admirable   understanding cultivated ,   &   her   temper   regulated ,   than   her   Papas   fondness would   perhaps   allow   while   she   was   an   only   child . You   will   see   by   the   date   of   my   letter ,   I   am   still   in   the Northern   Regions ,   but   I   hope   in   a   fortnight   to   return   to London .   We   have   had   a   mild   season ,   &   this   House   is   remarkably warm ,   so   that   I   have   not   suffer'd   from   cold .   Business   has taken   up   much of   my   time ,   &   as   we   had   farms   to   lett   against   next   May   day ,   & I   was   willing   to   see   the   new   Colliery   begin to   trade   to   London   before   I   left   the   Country ,   I   had   the prudence   to   get   the   better   of   my   taste   for   society .   I   had   this day   the   pleasure   of   a   letter   from   Billingsgate   ( a   polite   part of   the   World   for   a   Lady   to   correspond   with )   that   the   first ships   which   were   then   arrived ,   were   much   approved ;   at   Lynn they   have   also   succeeded ,   &   these   are   the   two   great   Coal markets .   So   now   as   soon   as   I   can   get   all   the ends   &   bottoms   of   our   business   wound   up ,   I   shall   set   out   for Hillstreet .   I   spent   a   Month   in   Scotland   this   Summer ,   &   made   a further   progress   than   Mr   Gray   did .   An   old   friend   of   Mr Montagu's   &   mine ,   Dr   Gregory ,   came   to   us   here ,   &   brought   his daughter   ye   end   of   july ,   &   summond   me   to   keep   a   promise   I had   made   him   of   letting   him   be   my   Knight errant   &   escorte   me   round   Scotland .   The   first   of   august   we   set forward .   I   call'd   on   the   Duke   &   Duchess   of   Northumberland   at Alnewick   Castle   in   my   way ;   it   is   the   most   noble   Gothick building   imaginable ,   its   antique   form   is   preserved on   the   outside ,   within   the   apartments   are   also   Gothick   in   the structure   &   ornaments ,   but   convenient   &   noble ,   so   that   modern elegance   arranges   &   conducts   antique   strength   &   grandeur , leaves   its   sublimity   of   character ,   but   softens   what   was   rude   & unpolish'd .   My   next   days   journey   carried   me   to   Edinburgh , where   I   staid   about   ten   days ,   I   pass'd   my   time   there   very agreably ,   receiving   every   polite   attention   from   all   the   people of   distinction   in   the   Town .   I   never   saw   any   thing   equal   to   the hospitality   of   the   Scotch .   Every   one   seemd   to   make   it   their business   to   attend   me   to   all   the   fine   places   in   the Neighbourhood ,   to   invite   me   to   dinner ,   to   supper   & c .   as   I   had declared   an   intention   to   go   to   Glasgow ,   the   Lord   Provost   of Glasgow   insisted   on   my   coming   to   his   Villa   near   the   Town , instead   of   going   to   a   noisy   Inn .   I   stay'd   three   days   there   to se   the   Seals   in   the   Environs ,   &   the   great   Cathedral ,   &   the College   &   Academy   for   painting ,   &   then   I   set   out   for   Inverary . I   should   first   tell   you   Glasgow is   the   most   beautifull   Town   in   Great   Brittain .   The   Houses according   to   the   Scotch   fashion   are   large   &   high ,   &   built   of free   stone ,   the   streets   very   broad ,   &   built   at   right   angles . All   dirty   kinds   of   business   are   carried   on   in   seperate districts ,   so   that   nothing   appears   but   a   noble   &   elegant simplicity .   My   road   from   Glasgow   to   Inverary   lay   by   the   side of   the   famous   Lake   call'd   Lough   lomon .   Never   did   I   see   the sublime   &   beautifull   so   united .   The   Lake   is   in   some   places eight   miles   broad ,   in   others   less ,   adorn'd   with   many   Islands of   which   some   rise   in   a   Conrealent   figure   &   are cover'd   with   firr   trees   up   to   the   summit .   Other   Islands   are flatter ,   &   Deer   are   feeding   in   their   green   meadows ;   in   the Lontananza   rise   the   Mountains   on   whose   barren   breast , the   labouring   clouds   do   seem   to   rest . The   Lake   is   bright   as   crystal ,   &   the   shore   seems   of alabaster   pebbles .   Thus   I   travell'd   near   twenty   miles ,   till   I came   to   the   Village   of   Luss where   I   lay   at   an   Inn   there   being   no   Gentlemans   house   near   it . The   next   morning   I   began   to   ascend   the   Highland   Mountains .   I got   out   of   my   chaise   to   climb   to   the   top   of   one   to   take   my leave   of   the   beautifull   Lake ,   the   Sun   had   not   been   long   up , its   beams   danced   on   the   Lake ,   &   we   saw   this   Lovely   Water meandering   for     miles .   Immediately   after   I   returnd   to   my chaise ,   I   began   to   be   inclosed   in   a   deep   Valley   between   Vast mountains ,   down   whose   furrowd   cheeks   torrents   rush'd impetuosly ,   &   united   in   a   river   in   the   Vale   below .   Winter rains   had   so   wash'd   away   the   Soil   from   some   of   the   steep Mountains ,   there   appeard   little   but   the   Rocks ,   which   like   the skeleton   of   a   Giant   appeard   more   terrible   than   the   perfect form .   Other   Mountains   were   coverd   with   a   dark   brown   Moss ,   the shaggy   goats   were   browsing   on   their   sides ,   here   &   there appear'd   a   storm   struck   tree   or   blasted   shrub ,   from   whence   no Lark   ever   saluted   the   morn   with   joyous   hymn ,   or   Philomel soothd   the   dull   ear   of   night ,   but   from thence   the   Eagle   gave   the   first   lessons   of flight   to   her   young ,   &   taught   them   to   make   war   on   the kids .   In   the   Vale   of   Glencross   we   stopp'd   to   dine   by   the stream   of   Cona ,   so   celebrated   by   Ossian .   I   chose   to   dine amidst   the   rude   magnificence   of   nature ,   rather   than in   the   meanest   of   ye   works   of   art ,   so   did   not   enter   ye Cottage   which   call'd   itself   an   Inn ;   from   thence   my   Servants brought   me   fresh   herrings   &   trout   &   my   Lord   Provost   Wife   had fill'd   my     chaise   with   good   things ,   so   very luxuriously   we   feasted .   I   wishd   Ossian   wd   have   come   to   us   & have   told   a   tale   of   other   times   ,   however   imagination   & memory   assisted ,   &   we   recollected   many   passages   in   the   very places   that   inspired   them .   I   staid     hours   listening   to   the roaring   stream ,   &   hoped   some   ghost   wd   come   on   the   blast   of the   Mountain ,   &   shew   us   where   three   gray   stones   were erected   to   his   memory .   after   dinner   we   went   on about     miles   still   in   the   Valley ,   Mountain   rising   above mountain   till   we   ascended   to   Inverary ,   there   at   once   we entered the   Vale   where   lies   the   vast   lake   calld   Lough   Fine of   whose   dignity   I   cannot   give   you   a   better   notion , than   by   telling   you   the   great   Leviathan   had taken   his   pastime   therein   the   night   before   I   was   there   Tho   it is     miles   from   the   Sea ,   Whales   come   up   there   often   in   the herring   Season .   At   Inverary   I   was   lodged   at   a   Gentlemans   house invited ,   to   anothers   in   ye   neighbourhood ,   &   attended   the   Duke   of   Argylles   policy   ( such   is   call'd   the   grounds dedicated   to   beauty   &   ornament ) .   I   went   also   to   see   the   Castle built   by   the   late   Duke ,   it   appears   small   by   the   vast   objects near   it ,   this   great   Lake   before ,   a   Vast   Mountain   coverd   with firr   &   Beech   behind   it ,   so   that   relatively   the   Castle   is little .   I   was   obliged   to   return   back   to   Glasgow   the   same   way , not   having   time   to   make   the   tour   of   the   Highlands .   Ld Provost   had   an   excellent   dinner   &   good   company   ready   for   us . The   next   day   I   went   to   Ld   Kames   near   Stirling ,   where   I   had promised   to   stay   a   day .   I   passd   a   day   very   agreably   there ,   but cd   not   comply   with   their obliging   entreaties   to   stay   a   longer   time ,   but   was   obliged   to return   to   Edinburgh .   Ld   Kames   attended   me   to   Stirling Castle ,   which   is   in   the   road ,   &   from   thence   to   the   Iron   works at   Carun   Here   again   I   was   on   Classick   ground .   We dined   at   Mr   Dundass's ,   at   night   I   got   back   to   Edinburgh , where   I   rested   my   self     days ,   &   then   in   my   road   lay   at   S=r Gilbert   Elliots ,   spent   a   day   with   him   &   Lady   Elliot .   They facilitated   my   journey   by   lending   me   relais   ,   which   ye   route did   not   always   furnish ,   so   I   sent   my   own   horses   a   stage forward .   I   crossd   the   Tweed   again ,   dined   &   lay   at   the   Bishop of   Carlisles   at   Rose   Castle ,   &   then   came   home   much   pleased with   the   expedition ,   &   gratefull   for   the   infinite   civilities   I had   received .   My   evenings   at   Edinburgh   passd   very   agreably with   Dr   Robertson ,   Dr   Blair ,   Ld   Kames ,   &   diverse ingenious   &   agreable   persons .   My   friend   Dr Gregory ,   who   was   my   fellow   traveller   tho   he   is   a   Mathematician has   a   fine   imagination ,   an   elegant   taste and   every   quality   to   make   an   agreable   companion ;   he   came   back to   Denton   with   me ,   but   soon   left   us .   I   detain'd   his   two daughters   Who   are   still   with   me ,   they   are   most   amiable children ,   they   will   return   to   their   Papa   a   few   days   before   I leave   this   place .   I   was   told   Mr   Gray   was   rather   reserved when   he   was   in   Scotland ,   tho   they   were   disposed   to   pay   him great   respect .   I   agree   perfectly   with   him ,   that   to   endeavour to   shine   in   conversation ,   &   to   lay   out   for   admiration ,   is   very paltry ,   the   witt   of   the   company   next   to   the   Butt   of   the company   is   the   meanest   person   in   it ;   but   at   the   same   time , when   a   man   of   celebrated   talents   disdains   to   mix   in   common conversation ,   or   refuses   to   talk   on   ordinary   subjects   it betrays   a   latent   pride .   There   is   a   much   higher character   than   that   of   a   Witt ,   or   a   Poet ,   or   a   Savant ,   which is ,   that   of   a   rational   &   socible   being ,   willing   to   carry   on the   commerce   of   life   with   all   the   sweetness   &   condescension decency   &   virtue   will   permit .   The   great   duty   of   conversation is   to follow   suit ,   as   you   do   at   Whist ;   if   the   eldest   hand   plays   ye deuce   of   diamonds ,   let   not   his   next   neighbour   cast   down   the King   of   hearts   because   his   hand   is   full   of   honours .   I   do   not love   to   see   a   man   of   witt   win   all   the   tricks   in   conversation nor   yet   to   see   him   sullenly   pass .   I   speak   not   this   of   Mr Gray   in   particular ,   but   it   is   the   common   failing   of   men   of genius   to   exert   a   proud   superiority ,   or   maintain   a   prouder indolence .   I   shall   be   very   glad   to   see   Mr   Gray   whenever   he will   please   to   do   me   the   favour .   I   think   he   is   the   first   Poet of   the   age ,   but   if   he   comes   to   my   fireside ,   I   will   teach   him not   only   to   speak   prose   but   to   talk nonsense   if   occasion   be .   I   w=d   not   have   a   Poet   always   sit   on the   proud   summit   of   the   forked   hill .   I   have   a   great   respect for   Mr   Gray   as   well   as   a   high   admiration .   I   am   much   grieved at   the   bad   news   from   Canterbury ,   the   Dean   is   a   great   loss   to his   family .   I   beg   my   most   affectionate   compts   to   my   Brother &   love   to   my   dear   little   neice .   I   am   sure   Miss   Arnold   was   very happy   with   you   she   is   a   most   amiable   prudent   good   girl   &   her manners   are   very   pleasing .   I   hope   you   design   to   come   to   London soon .   I   am   my   Dear   Madm   yr   most   affect   Sister   E M Mr   Montagu   begs   his   comp=ts . 
BC_1768_EMONTAGU_MB	and   firmness   could   get   through   such   hardships . From   his   behaviour   on   many   occasions   tho   he does   not   set   it   off   with   any   ostentation   he   seems very   humane .   I   have   been   greatly   amused   with Mr   Dows   account   of   Hindustan .   I   am   astonishd at   the   Learning   of   the   Bramins   &   the   wealth   of the   Rajas   but   I   had   a   greater   idea   of   the   last than   the   first   many   Travellers   having   thought   the   gold &   gems   worth   their   attention   but   not   the philosophy   I   am   not   acquainted   with   Mr   Dow but   I   wish   that   like   Solomon   having   first   sought wisdom   he   may   like   Solomon   also   find   wealth . I   wish   him   a   luck   of   Roupies   for   his   translations he   has   given   us   from   the   Eastern   philosophers . I   intend   to   amuse   Mr   Montagu   with   reading   to him   with   Sr   James   Porters   account   of   the   Turks   A   man   of   sense   who   has   resided   amongst   them in   a   publick   character   must   be   best   qualified to   give   the   character   &   customs   of   the   people .   Voltaire who   loves   any   people   who   are   not   Christians   has been   very   partial   to   the   Turks .   If   Mr   Montagu   grows very   well   this   Summer   I   shall   hope   for   an   opportunity to   pay   my   devoirs   to   your   Grace   in   the   Paradisaical Regions   of   Bullstrode .   Hitcham   is   so   near   that I   may   even   some   evening   have   the   pleasure   of   hearing   Mr Achard   like   another   Sr   Anthony   preaching   to the   Fishes .   I   am   sure   he   gave   them   very   good doctrine   not   to   quarrel   &   snatch   ye   bread   out of   each   others   mouths ,   I   wish   Mr   Wilkes   may preach   up   peace   in   the   same   manner   to   his Fry   .   I   saw   the   death   of   Dr   Delany   in   the   papers I   long   to   know   how   poor   Mrs   Delanys   spirits sustain   the   shock ,   but   to   write   to   her   wd   be improper   &   I   understand   Mrs   Sandford   is   in Ireland .   I   hope   as   she   was   prepared   by   the   Doctors long   declining   state   she   will   the   better   endure   it , I   have   troubled   your   Grace   with   a   very   long   dull letter ,   for   which   I   should   ask   pardon ,   but   you   must permit   me   sometimes   to   take   this   liberty .   My present   situation   will   make   me   a   bad   correspondent my   spirits   are   depressed   by   seeing   Mr   Montagu in   a   constant   state   of   suffering ,   &   the   hours I   am   not   with   him   are   much   filled   by   writing dull   letters   of   business .   I   have   got   my   Brother Morris   Robinson   second   son   with   me   a   little   man   of five   years   old ,   his   little   tricks   amuse   Mr   Montagu &   he   is   mighty   good   humoured   &   lively   &   in   such perfect   order   he   is   never   troublesome .   this   is   all the   company   we   have   in   the   House ,   &   of   Neighbours I   have   not   many ,   so   from   my   situation   I   am   furnished with   some   excuse   for   being   dull .   The   spirit   of road   making   has   operated   very   powerfully   so   that   we   have   various   turnpike   roads   for   our airings   which   is   very   convenient   at   this   time as   we   go   out   every   day .   Mr   Boyd   who   married Miss   Chapone   was   here   the   other   day ,   he   is   to dine   with   us   on   sunday ,   he   looks   much   happier than   before   he   married   her ,   he   is   a   very   worthy man   but   naturally   un   peu   triste   ,   however   L a   year   may   attone   for   some   defects .   She   makes   an excellent   Wife   &   Mother   in   Law ,   &   his   Relations   are   much pleased   with   her .   Mr   Montagu   begs   leave   to   present his   compts   to   your   Grace .   I   am   Dear   Madam your   Graces   most   Obliged most   Obedt   Hble   Servt   & c E   Montagu 
BC_1768_EMONTAGU_MR_1	Sandleford   july   ye   Dear   Sir A   thousand   thanks   for   your   excellent Venison ,   &   ten   thousand   for   your   more   excellent letter .   As   I   take   hearty   laughing   to   contribute   still more   to   embonpoint   than   hearty   eating ,   I   expect   greater benefit   even   to   our   Corporeal   part   than   I   should   from many   Venison   feasts   with   Mayors   &   Aldermen .   Your pen   has   better   painted   our   Divine   than   the   comick pencil   of   Hogarth   could   have   done .   When   I   read   your letter   to   Mr   Montagu ,   he   laugh'd   very   heartily ,   & said ,   it   set   Mr   Williams   figure   &   attitude   very   plainly before   him   .   We   agreed   that   we   should   not   have   expected a   weeping   Philosopher   from   you ,   &   could   no   way account   for   your   having   so   dolorous   a   Son ,   but that   my   Mother   had   been   frighten'd ,   by   the lamentable   tones   of   some   blind   beggar   in   an alley .   He   would   be   a   disgrace   to   the   worshipfull   company of   the   company   of   the   Taylors .   Forcible   Feeble   the Womans   Taylor ,   in   Falstaffes   Regiment ,   was   a   magnanimous person   compared   to   him ,   I   would   advise   his Wife ,   from   this   time ,   to   seize   upon   a   certain   part of   his   dress ,   which   may   fit   her ,   but   can   never   befitt him ;   let   her   give   him   a   warm   flannel   petticoat in   lieu   thereof .   I   am   anxious   to   hear   the   success   of the   cause ,   &   hope   to   be   inform'd   of   it   by   wen'sdays post .   I   am   sorry   to   say ,   that   William ,   even   if   he   shd be   a   rich   man ,   will   still   be   a   poor   Creature . I   wish   I   could   give   you   a   better   account   of   Mr Montagu's   health ,   tho   he   is   rather   stronger ,   &   looks less   infirm   than   when   he   left   London ,   there   is   not any   great   amendment   in   respect   to   his   cough . His   spirits   are   good ,   &   his   faculties   so   strong ,   that he   applies   a   great   deal   to   his   mathematical studies   as   he   sits   up   in   his   bed   in   the   morning ; he   rises   but   a   little   while   before   dinner ,   in   the evening   we   take   an   airing   in   a ye   post   chaise   &   four   , going   a   round   trott   for   about     hours .   In   this   situation I   owe   much   of   my   pleasures   to   the   education   you   kindly bestow'd   upon   me ,   a   habit   of   reading ,   so   early   commenced that   the   love   of   it   is   become   a   passion ,   makes   me never   at   a   loss   how   to   fill   my   time .   In   bad   weather Mr   Montagu   goes   to   bed   at   six   or   seven ,   &   I   never feel   the   want   of   company ,   tho   my   choice   would not   be   continual   retirement .   As   Men   are   designed for   active   &   publick   life ,   I   think   a ye   love   of   reading is   hardly   so   necessary   for   them   as   for   Women ,   to whom   retirement   is   always   safe ,   &   sometimes   necessary . As   they   are   not   to   chuse   where   or   how   they   will live ,   it   is   happy   to   have   a   taste   that   may   be gratified   in   any   situation   or   any   circumstances . I   am   sorry   to   hear   you   intend   to   take   a   new   road to   Bath ,   as   it   will   deprive   us   of   a   visit   which we   expected   with   impatience .   Perhaps   I   may   have the   pleasure   of   seeing   you   in   a   very   few   days , for   Mr   Archdeacon   wants   a   paper   relative   to a   Colliery   in   the   County   of   Durham   of   which we   are   going   to   grant   a   new   Lease ;   this   paper being   in   Town ,   if   it   is   necessary ,   I   must   go   thither . I   shall   lye   at   Hitcham   in   my   way .   I   propose   to   stay only   a   day   or   two   in   London ,   &   then   return   directly to   Sandleford .   I   expect   every   post   to   hear   from   Mr Archdeacon ,   that   he   wants   this   paper ,   &   ye   copy   of the   old   Lease ,   as   he   tells   he   has   not   a   copy   of   either . I   wish   if   Mr   William   has   any   spare   tears ,   after   he has   got   his   cause ,   that   he   would   bestow   some   of them   upon   the   confusion   the   riotous   Coal   heavers have   made   in   the   coal   trade .   I   would   not   ask   any for   my   Hay ,   which   now   lies   a   piteous   object   in the   Fields   soaking   in   rain ,   for   it   has   already   had   too much   of   water .   The   way   I   take   on   such   occasions ,   if I   find   myself   disposed   to   complain ,   is   this ,   I   ask myself   pray   to   whom   should   I   complain ?   To   those who   have   Land   &   coal   mines ?   no ,   for   they   are   in the   same   circumstances !   To   those   who   have   neither ? less   still ,   for   they   are   in   worse .   Least   of   all   should I   complain   to   Mr   Montagu ,   for   the   first   duty   of   persons who   have   agreed   to   make   the   journey   of   life   together ,   is , not   to   make   that   journey   tedious   &   troublesome . I   have   travell'd   in   a   coach   with   people   of   different dispositions ,   some   of   my   fellow   travellers   by   chearful and   good   humour ,   in   spite   of   rough   roads   &   bad weather ,   have   render'd   the   journey   agreable ;   others ,   by gloominess   &   peevishness ,   have   robbed   the   smiles   of april   of   delight ,   &   by   squalling   &   pinching   made every   little   jolt   intolerable .   I   remember   some   years   ago , a   certain   Northern   Lady ,   saying   to   me   with   a   sorrowfull face ,   oh   Mrs   Montagu !   I   have   lost   this   year   three thousand   pound   by   giving   gift   coal ,   to   which   I replied ,   Oh !   Lady   -   it   is   a   very   happy   thing to   have   L   a   year   to   give   away   and   especialy   as I   suppose   yr   Ladyship   will   sell   that   quantity   of   coal   next year .   Half   the   murmurings   one   hears   in   the   World are   because   people   do   not   enjoy   on   perfect   good conditions ,   what   they   do   not   deserve   to   have   on the   worst .   I   admire   the   Philosopher ,   who   thank d the   Gods   first ,   that   he   was   a   man ,   &   then   that   he was   an   Athenian .   To   be   a   rational   creature ,   & to   have   had   the   advantages   of   a   liberal   education , to   be   raised   above   the   misery   of   want ,   &   the   evils of   dependance   or   slavery ,   are   great   felicities .   Whoever have   had   these   advantages   are   unworthy   of   them ,   if they   have   not   derived   thence   that   degree   of   magnanomity that   is   requisite   for   bearing   ordinary   disappointments . We   give   too   much   consequence   to   martial   courage &   too   little   to   civil .   We   teach   our   boys ,   that   is   is infamous   to   behave   cowardly   in   battle ,   that   there they   must   not   lose   their   intrepidity   or   presence   of   mind under   pain   of   being   infamous ;   yet ,   except   a   mans Country   is   invaded ,   he   may   do   all   his   duties without   going   to   battle ;   but   a   man   can   neither be   a   good   Husband ,   Father ,   or   Friend ,   who   cannot bear   up   against   common   calamities .   I   am   realy hurt   at   Williams   ingratitude   to   his   Wife ,   who certainly   has   gone   through   a   great   deal ,   between his   absurdity ,   &   the   peculiar   circumstances   of   the   tryal   at Law ,   for   the   sake   of   her   family .   I   beg   of   you   to   insist on   his   preaching   ( the   sunday   after   he   has   carried his   Cause )   on   this   text ,   I   am   a   worm   &   no   man   . If   he   will   let   me   make   the   sermon ,   I   will   prove him   to   ye   satisfaction   of   ye   whole   parish   not   only   a   worm ,   but   a   muck   worm . Mr   Montagu   is   very   thankfull   for   your   kind attention   in   sending   the   venison ,   which   is   a   thing he   much   loves ,   &   there   are   few   Parks   in   this Country ,   he   desires   his   best   compts .   Little   Matt sends   his   duty ,   his   Brother   wrote   him   a   very   pretty letter   in   a   very   fine   hand ,   of   which   he   was   very proud ,   but   cannot   answer   it   in   writing ,   for   my little   friend   is   no   great   Clerk .   I   believe   he   wd   have been   a   great   scholar   in   Ægypt ,   the   Hieroglyphicks   wd have   engaged   him ,   for   he   is   very   attentive   to forms ,   but   letters   do   not   hit   him .   He   is   a   charming boy ,   &   pray   tell   his   Papa   &   Mama   that   he   is   in perfect   health .   I   am   glad   my   little   nephew   Morris is   so   well ,   &   I   desire   my   love   to   him ,   &   that   I   hope his   Brother   will   endeavour   to   follow   his   example in   being   a   good   scholar .   If   Mrs   W:   Robinson   is   with you ,   please ,   with   my   compts ,   to   assure   her   of   my earnest   wishes   of   success ,   but   however   that   may   be , her   Children   will   be   ever   obliged   to   her   for   trying the   cause .   The   venison   came   perfectly   fresh ,   it   arrived yesterday   morning   We   are   to   eat   it   today .   Capt   Derby and   Mrs   Derby   are   to   partake   of   our   Venison .   We   sent an   invitation   to   Sr   William   St   Quintin   but   he   did not   return   to   Newtown   from   his   Daughter   Griffiths as   was   expected .   If   Mr   William   should   lose   his   cause , we   will   desire   him   to   draw   out   an   account   between his   Havings   &   his   Deservings   ,   &   see   whether   the balance   is   not   still   on   fortunes   side .   We   shall   set out   with   a   very   good   Imprimis   An   excellent   Wife   with ten   thousand   pounds ,   then   follow   Items   Burford   &   Denton   Livings , and   his   money   from   the   Captain ,   on   the   other   side there   will   be   his   Learning   &   his   diligence   & c . I   think   I   have   trespass'd   much   on   your   leisure   in   this long   letter ,   but   I   believe   London   is   at   present   very empty ,   so   you   may   have   time   on   your   hands . I   am   Dear   Sir   with   the   greatest   respect Your   most   Dutifull and   most   affectionte   Daughter Eliz   Montagu 
BC_1768_EMONTAGU_MR_2	Dear   Sir I   am   glad   to   seize   the   opportunity of   my   Fathers   going   to   Bath   to   thank   you   for your   obliging   letter ,   &   to   give   you   better   news of   Mr   Montagu's   health ,   who   for   these   ten   days past   has   been   making   advances   towards   health . I   approve   yr   motto   for   our   friend   Monseys   arms , &   I   can   tell   you   a   little   news   of   him ,   which being   mixd   with   the   name   of   a   King ,   will deserve   to   make   a   part   of   les   memoires pour   servir   a   l'histoire   du   Grand   Monsey   , which   I   believe   you   &   I   must   write ,   that ye   World   may   have   a   Copy   of   this   great Original .   He   invited   the   King   of   Denmark to   come   to   his   apartment ,   to   see   a   mathematical instrument   of   some   extraordinary   construction or   power .   His   Danish   Majesty   &   his   Courtiers were   afterwards ,   by   the   Doctor   introduced ,   I know   not   how ,   nor   why ,   into   his   bedchamber , where   they   were   first   saluted   by   the   general condition   of   ye   atmosphere   in   a   manner   which made   them   look   about   them :   the   first   object that   offer d   to   view   was   a   certain   porcelaine Vessel   which   some   people   put   under   ye   bed but   by   the   Doctor   is   ostentatiously   placed   about   a   yard from   it .   On   a   chair   lay   a   very   dirty   shirt , on   a   table   an   unpowderd   periwig ,   in   the window   stood   a   basin   full   of   ye   dirt   which ye   Doctor   had   that   morning   washd   off in   order   to   make   himself   fit   to   appear   in the   Royal   presence ,   some   of   this   soil   had been   gatherd   from   last   novembers   fogs , some   was   ye   perspiration   of   ye   dog   days , some   was   of   ye   smoke   of   winters   fire ,   some   of ye   dust   of   Summers   journeys .   Near   this basin   lay   a   greasy   night   cap ,   on   the   floor were   scatterd   old   shoes ,   dirty   stockings ,   pocket handerchiefs ,   stray   stocks   & c .   His   Danish Majesty ,   undoubtedly   like   his   ancestor   Hamlet stoppd   &   cry d ,   angels   &   Ministers   of   Grace   defend   us ! &   much   question'd   whence   came   ye   airs   &   blasts   that saluted   his   nostrils . I   hope   the   late   fine   weather   has   assisted the   salutary   qualities   of   the   Bath   waters &   will   facilitate   your   recovery   for   which   I   am most   truly   anxious .   If   you   return   from   Bath any   time   this   month ,   I   believe   you   will   find me   at   Sandleford ,   as   Mr   Montagu   is   so   much better ,   I   intend   to   endeavour   to   perswade him   to   go   to   Town ,   if   he   does   not   go   I   shall easily   obtain   leave   to   go   myself ,   &   to   stay there   till   the   Winter   in   this   cold   house   makes him   ill   enough   to   want   a   nurse ,   &   then   I   shall undoubtedly   return   to   my   post ;   in   ye   mean time   the   chearfullness   of   society   will   give me   spirits   that   may   enable   me   to   struggle through   a   dreary   season .   Six   months   that   I have   pass d   here ,   without   ye   least   society without   any   of   ye   pleasures   ye   Summer usually   affords ,   is   enough   for   me   at   a   dose . I   think     months   more   wd   be   mortal   poison , but   if   Mr   Montagu's   health   wd   not   allow him   to   travel   I   wd   swallow   that   poison . However   I   do   not   intend   to   undertake   a   lash I   am   so   unequal   to   de   gayête   de   Cœur   . Mr   Montagus   cough   is   surprizingly   abated he   has   got   a   habit   of   lying   in   bed   till   , &   of   returning   to   bed   between     &   ,   but   he reads   all   the   morning   &   sleeps   very   well all   night ,   so   that   lying   in   bed   is   habit   & choice   more   than   from   any   other   cause .   I   think I   never   knew   any   Summer   so   unpleasant   as this ,   some   days   allowd   a   walk ,   but   few   that saunter   &   garden   reverie   which   one   enjoys when   one   can   sit   out   of   doors .   We   have   just almost made   an   end   of   our   barley   harvest .   The   Wheat   sold   last market   from   L   to   L   a   load .   The   barley   in   this   Country has   sufferd   much   from   bad   weather   we   have escaped   better   than   most   people .   I   hope   Pig   meat   will be   very   cheap   this   winter ,   which   is   a   great   news   to   ye   poor I   shall   rejoyce   to   hear   of   yr   better   health   I   am   Dr   Sir   yrs   & c   E M 
BC_1768_EMONTAGU_SS_1	Jan   ye   I   was   much   rejoyced   to   receive a   testimony   of   my   dear   Sisters   not   being   absolutely frozen   by   the   severity   of   this   Season ,   it   is   realy   quite horrid .   I   have   not   stirr'd   from   the   fireside   for near   a   fortnight ,   but   have   nevertheless   been visited   by   a   most   severe   cold .   It   is   now   better but   my   jaws   &   teeth   were   very   painful   in ye   night ,   so   I   shall   be   obliged   to   shorten   my letter .   I   think   I   cd   contrive   to   send   our   Gardener over   to   Hitcham   for   a   few   days   in   ye   months of   feb   &   march .   I   will   write   to   Dr   Gregory   for a   soots   Laddie ,   &   if   possible   he   shall   play   in   ye pipe   to   make   our   hearts   fu'   o'   glee .   I   am sorry   poor   Fielding   has   but   a   small   chance to   have   her   sun   set   so   pleasantly   as   it   wd do   at   Hitcham .   I   imagine   she   wd   be   vastly happy   there   sitting   between   you   &   Mrs   Cutts   without a   wish   that   wd   stray   beyond   ye   chairs   you   sat upon .   I   could   not   enjoy   Hitcham   if   it   was to   cost   that   good   Woman   all   her   happiness , &   whatever   deprived   her   of   you   wd   do   so ;   therefore she   must   not   be   left   out .   You   may   depend on   my   making   ye   affair   quite   easy ,   so if   you   please   draw   ye   scheme   &   then   as you   know   her   income   subtract   what   is   above it   &   I   will   lay   down   the   stake .   My   friend   Fielding is   too   much   of   a   Bel   esprit   to   know   a   little of   ye   ordinary   affairs   of   life   so   you   need   not fear   she   shd   detect   you .   Witts   as   well   as Physicians   rank   eating   &   drinking   among ye   non   naturals ,   so   we   can   cheat   her   as   to knowledge   of   ye   expense   &   let   her   imagine her   present   income   equal   to   it .   I   had   much rather   she   did   not   know   she   was   assisted   in   it . For   my   part   in   matters   of   giving   I   have no   affectation   of   secrecy ,   where   it   is   an   honour to   ye   Person   to   receive   a   mark   of   ones kindness   I   shd   never   take   ye   least   thought of abt   concealing   it ,   but   it   can   never   be   pleasant to   one   as   ill   provided   with   money   as   Fielding to   think   about   it ,   &   to   feel   a   dependance   upon another   for   what   humanly   speaking ,   she   ought to   have   of   her   own ,   it   is   better   she   shd   not be   made   sensible   of   it ,   &   indeed   it   is   better for   me   because   whatever   draw   back   it   wd be   upon   ye   money   expended   so   much   I   shd lose ,   as   it   wd   not   procure   her   ye   happiness for   which   I   expended   it .   I   am   afraid   some rumour   of   this   scheme   of   Hitcham   shd   reach   her   ear &   kill   her ,   so   I   speak   in   case   you   see   danger of   her   knowing   of   it ,   if   there   is   not   you can   then   wait   till   you   have   better   Hopes   of her   recovery .   I   sent   yr   letters   directly ,   nothing is   more   easy   than   to   convey   a   letter ,   so   at any   time   you   may   enclose .   I   think   you   hit ye   point   right   in   regard   to   her   G:   of   Beaufort if   possible   save   her   money ,   if   not   save   her pride ,   if   it   is   to   be   done   at   a   moderate expence .   Poor   Old   Atkinson   is   fallen   very   ill but   not   in   immediate   danger .   It   is   a   great comfort   to   me   that   I   made   him   quite   happy when   I   was   at   Sandleford   by   allowing   him L   a   year ,   he   boarded   at   a   farm   House .   As   soon as   I   heard   he   was   sick   I   orderd   him   a   nurse &   desired   Woodhouse   to   send   him   wine   &   what ever   he   wanted   &   I   was   very   glad   to   hear last   post   that   Mr   Montagu   had   orderd   a nurse   &   that   he   shd   not   want   for   any   thing I   think   Mr   Montagu   is   often   harsh   more by   doctrine   than   disposition ,   as   I   removed   this poor   old   Creature   out   of   his   place   for   which he   was   unfit   yet   had   I   vexd   &   grieved   him   I   shd have   thought   I   had   shortend   his   days   but since   I   went   to   Sandleford   he   has   been   quite happy .   Mr   Withers   thinks   he   cannot   recover any   good   state   of   health .   Papa   is   vastly   good humoured   &   is   grown   very   fond   of   little   Matt . He   goes   often   to   dine   in   Chancery   Lane   tho ye   weather   is   so   severe .   I   am   to   dine   at   Mr Noods   to   day   at   Lady   Herveys   to   morrow   on sunday   tuesday   &   wensday   I   am   to   have   company At   dinner ,   &   on   monday   I   am   to   dine   with Mr   &   Mrs   Pulteney .   All   this   is   very   bustling of   late   I   have   been   very   quiet ,   but   the   weather has   been   so   severe   my   pen   has   often   dropped out   of   my   fingers .   I   am   very   proud   of   Dr   Monseys approbation   &   very   desirious   to   keep   it ,   but cannot   imagine   how   I   came   by   it .   I   have   no title   to   it   but   great   respect   for   him   &   love   for his   pretty   Jen   who   I   sent   to   invite   to   dinner an   age   ago   but   he   was   engaged .   I   shall make   another   attempt   soon   to   get   him   hither . Adieu   my   Dear   Sister   be   carefull   of   yr   self till   ye   weather   returns   to   some   moderation I   long   for   spring   that   we   may   meet   at our   Bower   of   bliss   sweet   Hitcham .   I   hope   it may   be   possible   to   avoid   my   campaign to   Northumberland   this   Summer .   I   wish   you a   happy   new   year ,   &   very   many :   your   short chin   &   my   long   chin ,   yr   short   nose   &   my   long nose   meeting   over   ye   fire ,   to   which   junction tho   yr   elder   Sister   you   see   I   shall   go   more than   half   way .   I   am   ever   most   affectly   yrs 
BC_1768_EMONTAGU_SS_2	Thursday   morn My   Dear   Sister I   had   the   pleasure   of   my   dear   Sisters letter   yesterday ,   &   tho   I   have   been   pesterd   to   death with   notes   &   letters   this   morning ,   I   will   just write   a   line   to   explain   myself   about   Hitcham . It   was   merely   for   fear   of   precipitating   yr   going there   to   yr   inconvenience   that   I   said   I   wd   go early   to   Sandleford ,   it   will   be   much   more   agreable to   me   to   come   to   you   the   moment   you   will take   me ,   but   I   feard   saying   so ,   for   ye   reason abovementiond ,   knowing   you   wd   strain   yr poor   nerves ,   &   made   yr   poor   head   kind ake   out   of kindness   &   indulgence   to   me .   As   to   yr   being settled   in   form   I   desire   it   not ,   if   there   be a   bed   to   lye   on ,   a   chair   to   sit   on ,   a   table   to write   on ,   &   my   dear   Sister   it   suffices .   I   wd   not belong   as   many   people   do   to   the   things   about them   for   ye   World .   It   seems   to   me   always   that good   conversation   is   the   great   elegance   of   life ,   & to   be   first   provided   for ,   &   be   assured   if   you   get to   Hitcham   yr   humble   Servant   will   not   wait till   ye   Inventory   is   completed .   You   shall let   me   know   what   is   deficient   in   yr   Worldly goods ,   &   I   will   send   down   per   waggon   whatever is   wanted .   I   shall   send   a   good   bed   &   matress , &   I   wish   I   could   send   pillows   stuffd   with   the best   poppies   that   crown   the   brows   of   Morpheus for   alas !   with   all   appurtenances   &   means to   bed   I   am   oft   a   poor   sleeper .   I   have   put self   &   jaws   into   Sr   John   Pringles   hands who   gives   me   Cinnabar   of   antimony   every night   &   I   think   I   am   better .   I   shall   enquire why   Mr   Coote   does   not   appear .   I   know   he tells   every   body   you   have   his   House . I   am   to   dine   at   Papas   with   Mrs   M   R. We   met   at   Mrs   Bests   she   was   humble &   express'd   concern   at   having   offended .   I   think just   as   you   do   but   implacability   wd   have been   imputed   &   it   becomes   not   peccable Beings   to   be   unforgiving   &   what   one ought   not   to   be   one   even   ought   to   appear to   be   on   acct   of   example .   I   am   to   go   to   Macbeth to   night   I   must   dress   for   my   early   dinner so   will   write   again   soon .   It   is   great   comfort to   me   that   ye   month   of   April   which has   made   so   made   so   many   fools ,   will demonstrate   me   a   Wise   Woman   as I   shall   leave   the   follies   of   this   Town   for the   rational   &   substantial   joys   of   friendship . The   Grand   Allies   at   Newcastle ,   to   break ye   lesser   coalowners ,   have   encreased their   measure ,   which   will   be   a   great present   loss   &   future   gain   to   us .   I   detest ye   cruelty   of   ye   proceeding ,   &   I   dont   like to   lose   in   ye   present   so   great   a   share of   profit   as   this   will   affect ,   however I   must   submit   to   ye   loss ,   but   thank   God shall   not   have   any   share   in   the   sin of   desiring   to   monopolize .   My   heart   feels for   those   who   have   great   rents   to   pay   for their   Mine ,   bad   coal ,   long   leads   &   no   Capital this   is   ye   case   of   many ;   none   of   those are ,   thank   God ,   ye   case   of   yr   Hble   Servant , who   cd   live   pretty   well   if   there   were   no such   Commodity   as   coal ,   &   shall   therefore with   surviving   Coal   owners   get   ye   better share   of   trade   hereafter   for   this   havock   among the   Brotherhood .   The   fools   in   Town   will   rejoyce that   coal   will   be   cheap   at   present   not knowing   these   jocky   tricks   will   lead   to   future scarcity .   Dont   mention   this   as   I   dont love   to   quarrel   with   any   set   of   people ; but   I   detest   these   proceedings   or   properly speaking   Measures   .   I   cannot   tell   how   ye bills   came   to   be   Soln   .   I   gor   L   changed   from cash   at   Sr   G:   Colebrooks   &   all   have   been taken   witht   endorsment ,   you   may   return it   I   will   stand   ye   hazard   which   is   not   great . I   am   my   Dear   Sister Ever   most   affectly Yrs E M I   rejoyce   to   think   worthy Fielding   will   partake   of   our   happy   situation 
BC_1768_EMONTAGU_SS_3	ye   My   Dr   Sister I   sent   the   Lease   to   my   Bror   &   yr   letter to   Mr   Coote   as   soon   as   they   came   to   hand .   I   am of   opinion   Joseph   Woodhouse   had   best   visit the   Cows   &   see   whether   they   deserve   ye   price set   on   them .   However   I   went   this   morning to   Mrs   Freind ,   who   will   send   her   Son   to   me   to   talk over   such   matters .   Mrs   Freind   thinks   money   may be   stoppd   for   cropping   the   ground .   As   to   Kitchen furniture   you   must   not   have   it   on   Cootes appraisement ,   he   is   a   shabby   kind   of   man . I   can   buy   some   second   hand   for   you   &   send it   by   water   to   Maidenhead .   I   had   written for   the   Gardener ,   a   manly   man   will   be necessary   to   defend   so   many   Virgin   Ladies . I   will   send   about   the   leathers   as   soon   as Woodhouse   is   better ,   he   has   been   very   ill . As   to   Poultry   I   can   send   you   some   cocks   &   hens I   presume ,   in   Turkeys   we   have   been   unfortunate . It   will   not   be   inconvenient   to   spare Joseph   Woodhouse   for   a   few   days .   I   shd   think Pottatoes   might   answer   better   than   lucerne but   dont   know   much   of   such   matters . I   will   consult   these   who   do .   I   rejoyce   to   think we   are   so   near   meeting .   Mrs   Freind   says you   design   the   best   bedchamber   for   me   which will   be   quite   wrong ,   let   me   have   ye   worst as   I   shall   not   be   a   constant   inhabitant . I   dont   like   yr   lying   over   ye   Kitchen   it   will be   noisy   &   hot   for   you .   Mrs   Freind   seems   very happy   now   so   much   attention   has   been   shown to   her   Children   from   her   family .   alas !   poor Fielding ,   I   hope   she   is   out   of   this   Vale   of Tears .   It   must   be   a   great   comfort   to   you   to   think you   have   been   a   perfect   guardian   angel   to her   till   she   was   consignd   to   the   more   powerfull protection   of   higher   Beings .   Pray   buy   a   Bath pairing   with   ye   poor   remains   of   my poor   bill .   if   you   change   it   into   shillings   & get   them   gilt   in   ye   Bath   it   may   make some   figure .   As   to   Grunting   Hogs   &   squeaking pigs   I   can   supply   you   from   Sandleford .   & I   can   send   you   Cauliflowers   & c   from   China till   yr   Garden   flourishes .   Sandleford   is   now under   better   regulation   than   before   &   will produce   I   hope   plenty   of   such   matters . I   hear   my   Bror   Robinson   is   better   &   so perhaps   he   will   warble   sweet   his   woodnotes wild   in   fitter   scenes   than   Citties .   Mr   Pulteney tells   me   he   has   offerd   to   build   a   Bridge   at Bath   in   order   for   ye   new   Square ,   but   ye Corporation   had   not   accepted   his   offer when   he   mentiond   it   to   me :   they   were deliberating   upon   it .   I   had   a   great   many folks   last   night   &   I   feel   still   weary   but of   late   I   have   been   very   well . Mrs   Carter   who   dined   with   me   desired her   respects .   Ld   Lyttn   askd   after   you   last night .   Pretty   Mr   Moisy   was   here ,   he   is a   charming   youth   in   mind ,   person ,   & manners ,   &   I   thought   ye   Misses   seemd   to think   so .   I   had   not   a   Dram   only   a   few for   I   divide   my   acquaintance   into different   Soirees ,   I   take   abt     at   a   time   & at   that   rate   I   have   so   many   acquaintance they   may   make   mille   &   une   nuit   I am   afraid .   Mr   M:   grows   rather   better but   seems   much   worn   in   flesh   &   strength I   must   conclude   to   save   ye   early   post . It   joys   my   heart   to   think   I   shall   soon be   able   to   trip   &   tell   you   what   I   have to   say .   Compts   to   Mrs   Cutts   &   Miss   Arnold I   am   my   Dr   Sister Ever   yrs 
BC_1768_EMONTAGU_SS_4	My   dear   Sister I   am   ashamed   that   I   did   not   answer   yr letter   on   saturday ,   but   I   was   in   the   City   on business   in   the   morning ,   Mrs   Carter   dined   with me ,   &   early   in   ye   afternoon   I   was   to   go   to   Ld Shelburnes   to   see   a   representation   of   ye   last irruption   of   Mount   Vesuvius ,   which   was   painted in   Italy   in   liquid   &   transparent   colours   &   being   illuminated   behind , gave   a   very   strong   representation   of   ye   thing ;   it was   consignd   to   his   Lordship   in   its   way   to   the Brittish   Museum .   I   am   glad   you   are   moving towards   us   so   soon ,   whether   my   situation   will allow   you me   to   profit   by   it   I   cannot   tell   if   Mr   Montagu   is   better by   that   time   I   will   come   to   you   as   soon   as   you tell   me   it   is   convenient ,   but   he   is   not   in   such a   state   that   I   can   now   leave   him .   I   have   not even   been   out   above   two   or   three   times   for above     weeks   past .   We   have   great   hopes   from the   warm   weather   that   is   now   to   be   expected , but   tho   to   day   is   the   warmest   we   had   had , Mr   Montagu   is   not   so   well   as   he   was   yesterday . If   it   will   be   convenient   to   you ,   &   that   you   approve it ,   I   will   send   Woodhouse   my   Butler   down   a day   or   two   before   you   intend   to   be   there ,   because I   think   he   wd   attend   to   yr   fires   &   airings ,   for he   is   very   active   &   diligent .   Dr   Gregory   has   not yet   met   with   a   Gardener ,   &   he   wanted   to know   what   wages .   Under   gardeners   at   Lambeth have   ten   pound   a   year ,   &   their   victuals ,   so   I have   offerd   for   you   L   a   year   &   livery   frock   ye first   year ,   L   a   year   &   livery   frock   ye   second   year , for   you   will   want   a   better   gardener   rather than   these   I   mention   they   being   little   better than   labourers ,   &   you   must   have   a   man   of decent   character ,   &   such   will   not   leave   their Country   without   a   good   consideration   I   hope I   have   not   offerd   more   than   is   proper .   I   shall let   you   have   one   of   my   Men   to   guard   you till   we   can   get   a   proper   one .   I   will   train   up ye   fine   boy   we   call   little   John   for   a   Gardener for   you ,   when   little   John   is   great   John   you shall   have   him .   The   story   I   mention'd   to   you   was of   Ld   Beauchamp ,   I   know   not   any   story   of Ld   B-te ,   there   is   a   sad   one   about   his   Daughter Lady   P-y ,   no   one   knows   what   is   ye   affair , but   the   Lady   is   rusticated .   I   shall   send   ye   shins by   wensdays   carrier ,   &   will   write   there   with I   dont   like   this   writing   on   a   single   Vessel of   paper   it   cramps   my   genius   terribly   I   can only   write   ye   needfull   in   such   a   compass .   No news   of   Sr   John   Fielding .   Ld   Lyttelton   has been   out   of   Town   almost   a   Month ,   I   believe he   has   no   connexions   with   Sr   John   or   at   his   might   give   him   a   hint .   he   talkd   to   Town   abt   ye   middle   of   this   Mrs   Fieldings   maid   gives   proof   of her   zeal   but   she   must   make   her   poor   Mistress suffer   by   cramming   her   when   ye   internals are   weak .   Mr   Montagu   takes   little   food   but is   grievously   plyed   with   medicine ,   of   which he   often   complains .   We   had   strange   doings   with the   Mob   on   monday   &   tuesday   last .   they   calld us   up   at     in   ye   morning   &   those   who   were not   nimble   enough   to   get   their   candles   lighted had   their   windows   broken   tho   they   humbly   supplicated their   Majesties   the   Mob   to   give   them   time   to   obey them   &   they   wd   do   it .   At   Hyde   Park   corner ,   & all   through   Piccadilly ,   ye   Voters   from   Cook   &   Beauchamp were   sadly   pelted   their   carriages   broken .   Mr Holford   was   so   cut   as   to   lose   a   vast   deal   of   blood Mr   Townshend   arm   is   much   bruised .   My   Brother Morris's   chaise   was   broken   &   great   stones   thrown into   ye   chaise   but   he   received   no   harm .   Duke   of Leeds   narrowly   miss d   a   great   stone   threwn   at   him Whether   he   was   in   his   House   or   carriage   I   knew   not We   were   obliged   to   have   Servants   sit   up   all   night   on   tuesday with   illuminations ,   &   Mr   Wilkes   was   very   mercifull   in   his   orders   or   it had   been   worse   I   will   send   ye     ye   skin   on   wensday . 
BC_1768_EMONTAGU_SS_5	Sept   ye   I   am   sorry   that   my   Dear   Sister   has had   a   return   of   the   pain   in   your   bowels   which   is very   wearing ,   but   realy   I   was   revived   with   the account   you   gave   me   in   yr   letter   which   I   received on   sunday   of   the   good   company   you   had   seen   in   yr Prison .   I   was   very   uneasy   least   you   shd   be   tempted to   apply   too   much   in   yr   solitude ,   or   if   you   were too   infirm   for   application   suffer   from   l'ennui   . I   shd   have   been   very   uneasy   at   not   receiving yr   first   letter   on   wen'sday ,   if   Israel   had   not   sent me   word   you   were   pretty   well ,   &   that   you   talkd of   writing ,   so   I   suspected   yr   Chelsea   letter   man of   playing   me   a   trick .   I   had   a   letter   from Miss   A:   Morritt   of   York   on   sunday ,   telling me ,   she   had   collected   up wards   of   L   for   Miss   Sterne , that   she   had   promised   ye   subscribers   it   shd   be converted   into   an   annuity   for   the   Girl   for she   added ,   Mrs   Sterne   was   so   little   loved   or   esteemd there   wd   not   have   been   a   single   guinea   given if   that   condition   had   not   been   made .   I   had   heard Miss   Morrit   extreamly   well   spoken   of ,   &   by   her manner   of   acting   by   the   Sternes ,   &   from   her letters ,   I   imagine   she   has   an   uncommon   share of   goodness   &   of   sense .   She   begs   of   me   to   advise Miss   Sterne   not   to   affect   witt ,   a   desire   of   being distinguishd   that   way   she   says   has   ruind the   whole   family .   I   shall   now   tell   Miss   Sterne I   will   allow   her     L   pr   ann:   &   I   hope   that   will give   my   advice   more   weight .   She   writes   with ye   highest   sense   of   the   blessing   of   this   collection , &   is   now   gratefull   to   God   &   her   benefactors ,   but how   far   the   pride   of   her   Mothers   precepts &   the   levities   of   her   Father   may   have   renderd her   uncapable   of   deep   impression   of   that   kind I   cannot   tell .   Ld   Rockingham   subscribed   guineas ,   as   in   fact   did   Sr   G:   Savile   tho   he gave     of   them   without   his   name ,   because he   wd   not   seem   to   give   more   than   Ld   Scarborough how   delicate   &   how   generous !   As   Mrs   Drummond has     lovely   Children   I   cannot   suspect   her bringing   one   into   ye   family   by   a   warming pan   but   I   am   surprized   to   see   in   ye   papers that   she   is   brought   to   bed   of   a   Daughter ,   she pass d   ye   last   day   she   was   in   London   in   Hillstreet in   the   month   of   May ,   &   I   did   not   perceive she   was   with   Child .   It   is   rather   a   comfort   to me   in   these   times   of   flood   that   you   are two   pair   of   stairs   high ,   but   it   has   occurrd to   me ,   that   tho   safe   from   water   you   may be   in   more   danger   of   fire .   I   hope   the   people of   the   House   are   very   carefull   about   ye stoves .   Our   Newtown   River   overflow'd   its   banks but   not   to   ye   degree   it   does   sometimes ,   ye newspapers   are   full   of   strange   disasters by   the   floods .   I   dined   on   friday   at   Mr   Derbys with   ye   Knight   of   Courtesy ,   he   is   gone   back to   Bath .   I   think   little   Matt   stands   some chance   of   passing   his   Winter   here .   I   shall   contrive to   keep   him   while   we   stay   here ,   &   at   London I   will   send   for   him   every   other   day .   perhaps Madam   will   be   afraid   to   buffet   him   about when   he   will   have   so   many   opportunities   of telling   it ,   besides   certain   events   may   possibly perswade   ye   Parents   to   leave   him   a   good deal   to   me .   I   am   sure   the   Childs   gentle   spirit must   suffer   at   ye   racket   made   among   ye Servants ,   for   he   is   gentleness   itself .   He   has   got   a little   touch   of   ye   fashionable   complaint   but   is not   disorderd   by   it   so   a   little   rhubarb   will set   ye   matter   right   again .   I   cd   not   send   you any   partridges   for   ye   snow   last   year   destroyd them   in   a   cruel   manner ,   &   we   have   yet got   but   a   brace   which   were   killd   on   saturday . A   Voracious   fox   destroy'd   us   nine   Turkeys on   saturday   last .   My   dressing   room   is   very pleasant   &   tho   winter   will   rob   it   of   its   beauty its   being   dry   &   unshaded   will   be   comfortable in   Winter .   Mr   Montagus   vigour   of   mind   seems to   indicate   a   longer   continuance   than   his emaciated   body   &   continual   cough   wd   make me   expect ,   he   is   very   placid   &   I   think   I   have not   many   years   known   him   so   good   humoured . Mrs   Boscawen   tells   me   she   saw   our   Bror   Charles ride   by   her   gate   as   he   was   returning   from Guilford ,   she   call d   him ,   made   him   eat   some peaches ,   wd   fain   have   perswaded   him   to   have stay d   all   night ,   but   he   wd   not   so   much   as go   into   her   House .   He   was   Council   for   Maclane   . the   young   Dss   of   Beaufort   has   an   Intermittent fever   but   not   of   an   alarming   kind .   The papers   say   ye   Dowager   Lady   Hervey   is   dangerously ill ,   for   which   I   am   very   sorry .   She   is   one   of the   most   agreable   &   amiable   Women   I   ever knew   that   belonged   to   ye   fine   World .   She   has shewn   great   constancy   &   fidelity   in   her   Friendships , as   many   of   ye   Friends   of   her   youth as   are   now   alive   still   live   in   great   union with   her .   She   has   most   obliging   &   kind   attentions to   her   Friends ,   great   zeal   for   their   welfare ,   loves to   praise   those   she   thinks   have   merit ,   &   is above   scandal ,   tittle   tattle ,   malice   & c .   Her House ,   her   table ,   her   manners   are   all   elegant , &   her   turn   of   conversation   very   agreable .   She loves   to   have   people   of   sense   &   witt   at   her table ,   &   manages   ye   conversation   in   such   a manner   as   to   give   them   opportunities   to shine   without   seeming   to   shew   them   off . There   is   not   any   house   in   London   where   I   find such   a   pleasing   turn   of   conversation .   I   realy love   Lady   Hervey ,   &   shd   be   ungratefull   if   I   did not ,   for   she   behaves   with   a   sort   of   tenderness to   me   which   shews   she   loves   me ,   &   tho   from being   the   only   two   Women   who   have   circles of   beaux   esprits   ,   there   might   be   supposed   to be   some   envy ,   she   takes   pleasure   in   commending me   beyond   my   deserts   to   every   body .   If   she has   a   partie   that   she   thinks   may   be   particularly agreable   for   any   reason   whatever she   never   omits   inviting   me .   She   has   preserved the   agrémens   of   youth   to   old   age ,   &   is   ever in   her   person   pleasing .   Her   gouty   complaints hinder   her   going   out   except   in   fine   weather in   a   morning ,   in   the   evening   one   found   her reading ,   or   with   polite   &   agreable   people ,   & she   had   the   art   of   leading   the   concert .   I   am   so disgusted   with   the   silly   way   our   Ladies   have of   getting   into   whispers   like   boarding   school Misses ,   that   I   reap   but   small   delight   in the   parties   I   am   askd   to   at   most   Houses , tho   many   of   my   acquaintance   are   so   good as   to   compose   ye   circle   for   me   with   great indulgence   to   my   love   of   Beaux   esprits   .   I   thank God   I   have   been   so   well   ever   since   I   came   from London   that   I   have   enjoy d   the   pleasure of   reading   with   great   appetite ,   &   if   I   did   not dread   the   winters   tale ,   I   cd   pass   my   time   very well ,   but   the   fear   of   seeing   Mr   Montagu   in a   suffering   state ,   &   being   myself   enfeebled by   such   illness   as   a   damp   &   cold   house   may occasion ,   cannot   but   haunt   my   imagination . It   wd   be   better   for   Mr   Montagu   if   he   was   where he   cd   have   company ,   for   he   seems   delighted with   seeing   ye   Lansdills ,   or   young   Morgan or   any   thing   that   can   articulate .   My   misfortune is   that   I   cannot   take   delight   in   such   folks   & tho   as   you   say   I   shd   love   to   have   some   person to   whom   to   say   que   la   solitude   est   belle   ,   it must   be   one   who   knew   why ,   &   wherefore   &   how elle   est   belle   .   Mr   Woodhouse   is   really   good company ,   &   has   a   great   extent   of   intelligence , but   I   am   obliged   to   leave   him   to   my   oats , pease ,   &   barley ,   however   in   the   short   days   he will   have   leisure   to   read   to   me   when   my eyes   are   weary .   Shakespear   is   a   great   resource , but   attention   to   that   subject   prevents   my applying   to   read   History ,   which   is   my   great delight ,   all   other   study   is   like   eating   sweetmeats &   cake   &   biscuits ,   it   satiates   before   it   fills . I   am   glad   you   have   begun   acquaintance   with Mrs   Joddrel .   Is   there   then   such   a   miserable sinner   as   a   Mistress   to   Ld   Clare ?   Il   peccato &   il   penitenza   are   there   inseperably   joind . I   am   curious   to   know   the   private   history   of the   Princess   Barbarigo .   Does   she   come   here   after a   Sr   Charles   Grandison ?   I   shd   approve   of   Mr Fords   scheme   of   Sea   bathing   if   ye   season   of ye   year   were   favorable .   I   am   greatly   vexd at   ye   disorder   in   yr   bowels   do   not   write   more than   a   line   of   a   post   just   to   say   how   you   do . Johnny   Morgan   calld   here   yesterday ,   his   Sister is   now   at   Lady   Sr   John's ,   sure   her   Ladyship must   be   a   queer   peice   to   want   such   a companion .   Mr   Montagu   seems   gradually   to   encrease as   the   weather   grows   cold   which   is   a   bad   prognostick . I   shall   send   some   more   prog   when   I   think you   have   finishd   ye   other   but   you   eat   so little   one   shall   have   little   credit   in   serving yr   larder .   God   grant   success   to   yr   regimen .   I   wish it   was   less   tiresome   but   if   you   can   get   any abatement   of   headach   it   will   reward   you for   yr   trouble . I   am   my   Dear   Sister most   affectly   yrs E M 
BC_1769_EMONTAGU_BS	I   know   you   will   be   glad   to   hear that   I   have   been   for   these   four   days   free   from Fever   &   advancing   towards   health   in   a regular   progression .   I   expect   the   pleasure   of seeing   Mr   Montagu   &   Mr   Black   here   to   day . I   am   delighted   with   peoples   opinion   of poetical   farming ,   but   as   the   fields   of   parnassus produce   daisies ,   daffodils ,   &   primroses   we should   have   been   supposed   to   have   produced some   of   these   pretty   things   ready   for   similies . If   the   good   folks   knew   ye   Lady   of   the   manor is   a   Critick   they   might   imagine   she scattered   nettles   over   poetick   ground , such   being   too   often   the   practice   of   the Critical   Tribe .   Mr   Baker   has   obey d   your   orders for   since   you   wrote   I   have   seen   the   Essay advertised   in   a   morning   &   an   evening   &   I believe   the   Essay   is   in   a   fair   way   of   making its   fortune ,   for   the   Critical   Review   has   puffed it   most   egregiously ,   indeed   far   beyond   its merits ,   for   which   I   am   their   most   obliged Humble   Servant ,   &   the   more   as   I   did   not solicit   their   favour   by   sending   ye   book   or   by making   any   other   application .   In   The the   Critical Memoirs   of   the   times   the   said   essay   is   much praised   they   have   indeed   so   retailed   it out   that   it   may   satisfy   people   without buying   it .   I   shrewdly   suspect   the   reason why   ye   Booksellers   wd   not   advertise   it   was that   they   intended   to   have   ye   selling   it in   that   way ,   for   they   give   their   Readers not   only   a   taste   but   a   surfeit   perhaps ,   and I   believe   they   will   retail   out   almost   every line   in   ye   work .   The   Monthly   Review   &   ye Magazines   have   not   yet   taken   the   Essay   into consideration .   My   great   pleasure   is   no   one   finds me   out ,   &   whenever   they   mention   the   Author they   talk   of   him   ,   &   he   ,   so   that   they   make   me stroke   my   chin   to   find   whether   I   have   a great   beard .   A   gentleman   told   a   friend   of   mine the   Author   of   the   Essay   was   a   clever   fellow . I   propose   great   pleasure   in   settling   every   thing relative   to   the   management   of   this   Farm . My   late   illness   has   given   a   check   to   my scheme   of   going   to   the   North .   I   shall   make   it my   business   to   build   up   my   own   frail Tenement   of   clay   rather   than   inspect   Mr   Montagus Farm   houses   and   Farms   at   present .   It   mortifies me   that   I   cannot   this   Summer   make   him a   better   Steward ,   but   at   this   time   of   life   the   loss of   the   Friend   &   companion   wd   be   heavily   felt &   ye   agonies   I   hear   he   has   sufferd   during my   illness   shew   that   he   wd   pay   dearly for   any   thing   I   could   do   for   him   in   the North   should   I   fall   ill   there ,   &   fatigue   &   business might   have   that   consequence .   I   am   now for   the   first   time   going   to   take   ye   air .   I   hope you   received   my   letter   with   one   I   took   ye   liberty to   enclose   from   Mr   Shallot .   I   long   to   hear   that   ye Bath   waters   have   been   of   service   to   you . My   Sister   begs   her   best   compts .   Mr   Woodhouse his   humble   respects .   Vesey   is   gone   alas   to   Ireland . I   have   not   heard   any   thing   of   ye   Pitt   family lately .   May   heaven   support   them   and   their heavy   affliction .   With   entire   esteem   I   am   Dr   Sir   yr   most   affect &   faithfull   Friend   & Hble   Servt E M Yr   Nephews   request   is   so   reasonable it   will   I   doubt   not   be   complied   with there   may   be   some   difficulty   in   knowing   what   living is   in   a   Market   Town . 
BC_1769_EMONTAGU_EC_1	Sandleford     of   Oct   My   dear   Friend My   imagination   without   wing or   broomstick   oft   mounts   aloft ,   rises   into   ye Regions   of   pure   space ,   &   without   lett   or impedement   bears   me   to   your   fireside ,   where you   set   me   in   your   easy   chair ,   &   we   talk &   reason ,   as   Angel   Host   &   guest   Ætherial   should   do , of   high   &   important   matters .   We   will   not   deign   to   say a   word   of   Mobs   or   Ministers ;   of   fashions   or   the fashionable ;   of   the   Great   who   are   without Greatness ;   or   the   little   who   are   less   than their   littleness .   Pray   say   you ,   dont   let   us talk   nonsence !   No   my   dear   friend ,   nor   will we   talk   sense ,   for   that   is   worse .   We   will   say what   has   not   been   said   before ,   or   if   the   substance be   old ,   the   mode   &   figure   shall   be   new .   But here   comes   my   mutton   broth   for   my   supper , Mutton   in   epigram ,   chicken   in   surprize   or any   fantastick   dish   had   been   better   on   the occasion   for   mutton   broth   is   ye   very   common   sense of   cookery ,   &   has   quite   spoild   every   thing I   was   going   to   say .   Dear   how   it   smoaks !   but the   very   vapour   is   too   dense   to   nourish dainty   fancy ,   so   at   once   down   I   souse   into matter   of   fact .   I   had   ye   finest   walk   &   ye   sweetest airing   this   morning   that   I   could   have   when   my dear   friend   was   not   with   me .   Our   Commons rival   our   dear   Bagshot   Heath   &   tho   not borderd   by   forrest   are   sweetly   fringed   with   wood . The   morning   therefore   you   see   was   dedicated to   exercise   this   evening   except   one   letter of   business   was   given   to   ye   sauntering   reading the   late   Mr   Shenstones   letters .   They   have   made me   regret   I   did   not   know   him ,   not   from the   witt   or   genius   they   display   but   that I   fancy   I   shd   have   urged   him   to   have   had his   works   printed   by   subscription   a   few   hundred pounds   wd   have   given   him   ease .   His   taste was   above   his   fortune   &   to   purchase   some elegance   for   his   retirement   he   was   obliged to   deny   himself   many   little   comforts .   Fye upon   the   rich   &   great   who   profess d   to   admire his   works !   He   was   not   happy .   I   believe   a delicate   &   ingenious   mind   rarely   is   so   in a   Country   life ,   unless   a   Wife   &   children   fill up   the   vacant   hours .   Dullness   can   doze   over the   fire   the   whole   long   winter   evening   alone   , or   drawl   it   out   in   conversation   with   some   other child   of   dullness   that   happens   to   drop   in . This   poor   Man   seems   to   have   had   a   friendly good   heart ,   narrow   circumstances   &   ye   churlish World   sufferd   it   not   to   expand   itself .   He   appears to   have   had   no   strict   friendships   but   with   Authors , Authorship   is   to   authors   what   ye   Seize   quartier are   to   ye   German   Barrons   a   proof   of   meet   alliance ,   yet   I   have   a   sad suspicion   you   dont   honour   me   more   than you   did   a   year   ago .   The   more   shame   for   you thats   all   I   say !   You   may   guess   I   am   very   well by   my   being   so   foolish ,   &   indeed   I   am   as   well   as I   am   foolish ,   that   is   to   say ,   perfectly   well .   I   had a   very   melancholly   &   affectionate   letter   from the   Dowager   Dss   of   Beaufort   as   a   farewell .   Poor Woman !   Why   shd   not   Duchesses   love   Duchesses   as well   as   Authors   love   Authors ,   &   then   she   wd   have a   friend   to   go   abroad   with   her .   I   realy   grieve   for her .   I   sent   Miss   Talbot   a   fine   jolly   pheasant   yesterday so   I   do   wise   things   tho   I   say   silly   ones   &   that   has   been   ever my   ambition ,   ye     part   of   my   wish   I   am   sure   I   have accomplishd   &   when   I   write   my   life   I   think   I   can   make   ye   other   clear too .   I   shd   kill     birds   with   one   stone   if   I   wrote   my   own   history   Yrs 
BC_1769_EMONTAGU_EC_2	I   hope   my   Dear   Friend   is   safe   &   well   by her   fireside   enjoying   the   company   of   those   near   & dear   friends   from   which   she   has   been   long   absent . I   beg   my   best   thanks   to   Doctor   Carter   for   having made   me   so   happy   at   Sunning   &   I   hope   he   will be   rewarded   for   his   goodness   to   me   in   finding your   health   has   been   improved   there .   I   find   the good   effect   of   the   waters   on   my   bodily   habit   remain , &   I   hope   that   improvement   my   mind   always receives   from   conversing   with   you   will   do   so likewise ,   but   alas   the   hourly   delight   I   found   in your   conversation   makes   me   regret   my   change of   situation .   I   am   terribly   awkward   without   you , &   can   no   way   reconcile   myself   to   this   deprivation . Alas   I   ought   rather   to   consider   how   little   I   deserved to   be   so   happy .   I   really   believe   your   company had   a   great   share   in   my   recovery .   I   thank God   I   am   wonderfully   well   &   have   got   into a   habit   of   sleeping .   I   had   the   pleasure   of   finding Mr   Montagu   in   better   health   than   he   has   had for   some   years   &   my   little   Man   is   very   well &   very   good .   Mr   Montagu   had   company   at dinner   on   Monday   &   I   arrived   before   the   Dessert was   taken   off   the   table   tho   I   indulged   my Servants   at   Reading   with   that   meal   which good   health   &   exercise   enables   them   to   insert between   breakfast   and   dinner   without   detriment to   their   digestion   of   ye   one   or   appetite   to   the other .   On   tuesday   I   saunterd   about   the garden   with   great   delight ,   writing   a   letter between   each   walk   so   that   I   thought   my   vast epistolary   debt   in   some   degree   lessend   but yesterday   brought   me   more   letters   than   the most   able   &   strong   Tim   whisky   could   have carried .   A   broad   wheel   waggon   wd   have groaned   under   them .   Some   of   these   I   have answerd ,   others   will   sit   heavily   on   my   Soul   tomorrow . I   am   impatient   to   hear   how   you   found Miss   Talbot .   Since   I   came   hither   I   met   with Mr   Garricks   ode   printed   with   his   apology for   undertaking   the   arduous   task   of   writing an   ode ,   the   modesty   of   his   apology   should soften   ye   asperity   of   the   Criticks   if   Criticks asperity   could   be   soften'd   but   of   all   venemous weeping   things   they   are   the   most   deaf   to ye   voice   of   the   Charmer .   In   this   Preface Mr   Garrick   recommends   to   those   not   yet   establishd in   their   dramatical   faith   to   read   The   Essay , of   which   he   speaks   very   honourably .   I   suppose this   gave   occasion   to   what   Mrs   Vesey   said   concerning Mr   Garricks   approbation   of   it .   I   take this   kindly   of   him   because   I   suppose   he   now pretty   near   guesses   at   ye   Author ,   &   as   we   have not   been   upon   very   good   terms   it   is   the   more obliging .   At   the   end   of   this   little   pamphlet   he has   given   the   testimonies   of   the   great   Writers of   former   times ,   &   the   lively   writers   of   these times   to   the   merity   of   his   Shakespear , &   the   names of   each   Author   except   when   he   quotes   ye   Essay &   there   I   had   ye   satisfaction   to   read   Author   unknown I   know   with   ye   arch   malice   of   a   round   face   not   ye peevish   air   of   a   long   visage ,   you   will   say ,   Mr   &   Mrs Hoad   could   have   told   ye   Author .   I   sent   ye   dear   folks some   partridges   by   the   baggage   Waggon   to   stop their   mouths .   I   have   not   a   frank   &   I   will   not   make you   pay   double   postage .   I   will   get   some   franks   of my   Neighbour   Herbert   &   then   I   will   write   à   toute outrance   Let   me   know   how   you   do   &   what   you   do Best   respects   to   ye   Doctor   &   all   yr   family .   I   am   every   most   affectly yrs   E M 
BC_1769_EMONTAGU_ED	Sunday   ye   My   Dearest I   had   this   day   the   favour   of   your very   kind   letter   of   ye   ,   which   gave   me   the greater   pleasure   as   I   had   not   any   from   you   the post   before .   Mr   &   Mrs   Wilmot   dined   with   me yester   to   day   in   their   return   from   Eton   where   they carried   their   Son   &   little   Cicero .   The   Monthly Review   is   ye   only   periodical   paper   which   has not   treated   my   essay   with   indulgence ,   but   I think   they   will   not   do   the   work   much   harm , for   much   of   their   cavilling   is   unintelligible . They   say   the   language   of   ye   Essay   is   affected , &   in   many   places   corrupt ,   &   triumph   over a   sentence   falsely   printed .   They   write   with peevishness   &   ill   manners   even   to   great   Shakespear himself ,   so   how   can   his   poor   little   Critick hope   to   escape .   My   work   has   undoubtedly   many defects   &   deficiencies ,   but   if   it   keeps   its   ground till   these   carping   Pedants   write   a   better   Criticism it   may   flourish   long .   It   is   whispered   in   Town that   I   am   the   Author   of   ye   Essay ,   &   perhaps with   these   Reviewers   ye   work   has   not   met with   more   candid   treatment   for   being   a   Ladys . I   expected   all   Mr   Johnsons ,   Warburtons ,   &   Hurds friends ,   &   all   implicit   disciples   of   Aristotle upon   my   poor   work ,   so   upon   the   whole   I   am well   off   that   these   Monthly   Reviewers   have not   been   more   severe .   Wherever   I   think   their criticism   just   I   shall   profit   by   it ,   by   correcting ye   fault   they   blame   in   ye   next   edition ,   if my   work   lives   to   another   edition ,   as   there   is hope   it   may .   It   is   printing   at   Dublin .   I   repent I   did   not   advertise   it   again   before   ye   Jubilee ,   but I   have   sent written   to   Town   to   day   to   my   Sister   to get   it   done .   As   it   becomes   more   known   I   must expect   ye   scribblers   of   Grubstreet   to   attack   it in   daily   papers ,   but   I   am   so   far   well   qualified for   an   Author   that   I   bear   ye   criticks   lash with   great   fortitude .   I   had   more   reason   to fear   I   should   write   below   Criticism   than to   hope   to   write   above   it .   I   have   ventured to   contradict   many   establishd   prejudices concerning   Shakespear   &   concerning   ye   Drama itself ,   &   besides   that   each   Wit's   by   trade   my   foe Each   fool   is   naturaly   so . I   should   have   enclosed   my   Brothers   letter   last post ,   but   feard   my   frank   wd   be   overweight . I   have   got   Mrs   Rutters   bond   safe ,   &   will   give it   to   you   when   I   come   to   Sandleford .   My   spirits appetite   &   rest   are   improved ,   &   I   hope   I   shall not   have   any   violent   return   of   my   complaint . I   shall   have   had   a   due   share   of   these   waters in   another   week ,   &   hope   by   this   day   or   tomorrow sennight   to   return   home   to   you .   I   have idled   away   ye   summer   in   nothing   but   the pursuit   of   health ,   however   I   hope   to   be   the better   for   the   regimen   of   waters   &   exercise . I   long   to   be   at   home   again   with   you .   If   the night   proves   fair   I   will   endeavour   to   see the   Comet   which   is   certainly   a   phenomenon worthy   attention   &   I   am   afraid   even   my little   Matt   must   not   expect   to   see   it   again . There   is   one   Great   Being   in   whose   sight world   &   system   have   pass'd   away   as   roses &   Carnations   have   faded   before   us ,   but   we   have only   duration   enough   here   to   call   ye   puny insect   &   the   frailer   flower   short   lived   beings . I   beg   of   you   to   read   ye   doughty   Monthly Reviewers ,   &   where   you   find   ye   criticism just   when   you   have   referd   it   to   my   text I   will   correct   my   fault .   I   cannot   guess   what these   Criticks   wd   be   at   when   they   talk   that Nature   is   ye   Criterion   in   points   where   people do   not   agree   what   is   Nature .   You   will   see My   Brother   seems   much   pleased   with   my work ,   but   my   greatest   happiness   is   that   you are   so .   Papa   doats   on   ye   Essay   with   all   ye partiality   of   a   Grand   father ,   I   have   endeavourd to   put   a   padlock   upon   his   vanity   for   ye   Gentleman is   quite   vain   that   his   daughter   has   written   a book . I   wrote   my   letter   yesterday   in   expectation   of an   opportunity   to   send   my   letter   but   finding it   wd   reach   you   as   soon   if   sent   to   day   I reserved   it .   It   has   rain'd   incessantly   yesterday all   night   &   continues   to   do   so   which   renders this   place   very   uncomfortable   as   well as   hurts   ye   water .   I   am   to   dine   at   Mr Nevilles   to   morrow .   My   weekly   lodgings   are up   on   Wensday ,   so   I   will   go   to   London   that day ;   on   Thursday   see   Dr   Fothergill ,   &   if   the weather   mends ,   will   return   hither   on friday ,   if   it   continues   wet ,   the   waters will   be   spoild ,   &   I   will   return   to   you   at Sandleford   on   saturday .   I   think   myself considerably   better   upon   ye   whole   for   ye waters ,   &   if   the   weather   favoured ,   shd   like another   week   of   them ;   but   in   bad   weather they   are   thought   to   be   of   little   efficacy &   I   grudge   expence   &   illness   without gaining   health .   I   made   Susan   rise   last night   to   look   for   ye   Comet   but   it   was   not visible   so   I   did   not   get   up .   I   have   written   to little   Matt   to   incite   him   to   mind   his   back . If   he   does   not   take   care   his   Aunts   will have   written   in   their   lives   more   than he   will   read   in   his .   The   greatest   pleasure I   have   felt   as   an   author   is   from   your approbation   of   my   work   both   as   I   esteem yr   judgment   very   highly   &   think   every action   of   my   life   ought   to   be   directed to   pleasing   you .   With   perfect   esteem   &   most tender   affection I   am   my   Dearest Yr   most   faithfull &   Obedt   Wife E M monday   ye   please   to   direct   yr   next   to   Hillstreet 
BC_1769_EMONTAGU_EV_1	Wenesday   night ye   My   Dear   Friend I   know   you   will   be   glad   to   hear an   affectionate   Friend   is   on   ye   recovery .   I have   miss'd   my   fever   til   this   afternoon , &   tho   my   pulse   is   a   little   too   quiet   my amendment   to   day   is   most   visible .   My Doctor   tells   me   there   is   hardly   any   feverishness remaining ,   and   that   this   gradual decay   of   it   is   ye   best   retreat   it   could make .   I   cannot   help   laughing   at   all   the Guessers ,   &   exult   in   ye   guesses   when   they alight   on   Ld   Lyttelton   &   Mrs   Carter .   My book   is   certainly   à   la   Greque   tho   ye Author   is   no   Grecian ,   but   there   is   a   wonderful parade   about   ye   Grecian   Tragedians   . I   believe   it   will   grow   as   fashionable for   Ladies   to   put   on   Greek   as   to   put   on rouge ,   but   connoisseurs   will   distinguish from   counterfeits   ye   genuine   learning   &   genuine bloom .   I   am   glad   I   am   concealed   behind ye   Grecian   Masque ,   &   beg   ye   secret   may be   kept ,   &   then   I   may   amuse   myself with   scribbling   for   ye   publick   when   I please .   I   have   not   ye   heart   to   think   of   ye departure .   I   cannot   talk   of   it .   Wherever   you go ,   my   Dear   Dear   Sylph ,   you   carry   great part   of   my   heart ,   the   heart   has   a   magnetick power   over   ye   rest   of   ye   body ,   so   perhaps you   will   find   some   day   in   yr   bowers   of bliss   in   ye   Liffy .   Pray   return   my   thanks to   Ld   Lyttelton   for   his   amusing   &   friendly letters   which   I   will   answer   tomorrow ,   assure his   Lordship   that   I   am   getting   well   as   fast as   possible . I   am   my   Dear   Friend Ever   &   every   where   yours E M 
BC_1769_EMONTAGU_EV_2	Sandleford   june   ye   My   Dear   Madam Do   alps   rise   between   us   &   whole   Oceans   roll ? They   do   alas !   considerd   grossly ,   but   minds   once well   united   cannot   be   seperated ,   mine   follows you   over   hill   &   dale ,   goes   on   board   your   ship alights   with   you   on   the   Shore ,   follows   your most   secret   retreat   in   your   retired   bower , hovers   round   your   tea   table ,   even   tho   cups , sawcers ,   &   prating   Dames   make   a   barbarous atter   .   I   have   been   free   from   fever   these   five days ,   &   am   making   a   swift   progress   towards perfect   health .   I   was   taking   ye   air   on   the London   road   on   friday   morning ,   &   as   I was   reading   an   idle   book   I   pass'd   a   Post coach   without   perceiving   it ,   but   a   Servant came   to   my   chaise   window   with   Mr &   Mrs   Dunbars   compts   from   the   said   Coach . I   look'd   out   &   perceived   it   was   at   no   very great   distance ;   but   there   was   an   unwieldy Waggon   between   us ,   &   I   had   got   a   new Postillion   &   my   spirits   were   weak   &   I   durst not   turn   back   to   talk   to   them .   As   I   was     miles from   home   &   quite   out   of   their   route   I did   not   entertain   any   hope   of   getting   them to   go   with   me   to   Sandleford .   You   will   be   glad to   hear   that   doughty   Corporation   of   Criticks who   call   themselves   ye   Critical   Reviewers have   most   graciously   extoll'd   a   certain   essay indeed   far   beyond   its   desert ,   &   indeed   beyond the   Authors   conceit   of   its   merit   as   many good   people   in   all   the   Towns   in   England regulate   their   opinions   by   this   review   it is   lucky .   The   rich   Grocer ,   the   substantial Manufacturer   sits   &   reads   this   litterary   gazette with   implicit   faith ,   &   ye   Curate   ( who   dictates in   matters   of   learning   to   ye   Farmers   Heiress , who   at   boarding   school   learnt   to   read Novels )   takes   his   opinions   &   derives   his   knowledge from   ye   monthly   papers .   I   have   laid   aside all   thoughts   of   my   Northern   journey   &   intend to   employ   my   Summer   in   the   care   of   my   health . I   do   not   look   upon   the   Cave   of   Mammon   to   be wholesome   for   Invalids   so   I   shall   abandon   the   cares of   wealth   this   Season   to   attend   to   perfecting my   recovery .   The   Dryads   in   Hampshire   have been   extreamly   astonish'd   at   an   importation of   Shepherds   &   Shepherdesses   from   London .   Probably not   a   Pastor   Fido   or   faithful   lass   amongst them ;   the   glowworms   ineffectual   fires   were extinguishd   by   a   blaze   of   lamps ,   &   bursts of   Laughter   Drowned   the   notes   of   plaintive Philomel .   I   believe   ye   Duchess   of   Boltons   assembly   very   brilliant ,   but   as   the   Countess   of Desmond   was   not   there   I   did   not   regret   not   being   of   it . I   am   to   go   to   Town   upon   business   for   a   few days   next   week ,   &   I   will   then   send   you   all the   news   I   can   procure ,   &   especialy   what   may relate   to   our   Friends   for   as   to   the   rumours of   the   general   World   they   play   round   the   head   &   come   not   to   ye   heart My   Sister   desires   her   best   compts   Mr   Montagu   his respects .   My   affectionate   compts   attend   Mrs   Hancock and   Mr   Vesey .   Pray   tell   him   I   know   the   reason he   did   not   come   to   England   this   year ,   He   waits till   he   is   irresistibly   old ,   but   indeed   if   he   will not   come   till   he   is   perfectly   dangerous   I   will keep   out   of   his   way .   Tell   him   we   are   all   very   angry at   being   deserted   by   him ,   We   did   not   deserve   it   considering how   we   love   &   esteem   him .

BC_1769_EMONTAGU_EV_3	June   ye     My   Dear   Madam Your   letter   gave   me   great   joy , we   are   often   told ,   in   verses   &   in   prose ,   of   the   anxiety of   the   Merchant   whose   treasure   is   committed to   the   sport   of   winds   &   Waves ;   but   I   will   hope for   the   honour   of   human   nature ,   that   a   more tender   anxiety   is   felt ,   a   deeper   recess   of   the   heart feels   palpitation   when   a   Friend   is   to     the like   hazard .   However   I   know   for   my   part ,   I   never had   any   thing   I   valued   so   much   at   Sea   before ; even   you   were   not   so   dear   to   me   when   you embarked   the   last   time ,   for   I   know   you   better now ,   &   have   loved   you   longer ,   &   tho   I   love   as   well as   possible ,   I   have   now   had   experience   enough of   you   to   know   I   dont   love   you   too   well   which is   saying   the   handsomest   thing   I   can   ever   say to   you ,   tho   as   you   do   not   know   the   extent   of   my affection   you   cannot   understand   the   worth   of this   affirmation .   I   came   to   Town   last   Wensday   .   I   found a   strange   alteration   in   the   World .   My   friends   were all   in   their   rural   retirement ,   the   very   streets seem   deserted .   I   had   ye   pleasure   of   seeing   Mr Burke   twice   he   was   in   good   spirits   very lovely   &   agreable   but   he ,   his   friend   Ld   Verney &   Sr   Lawrence   Dundass   who   had   bought   India stock   for   a   time   had   sufferd   grievously   by the   bad   news   or   the   apprehensions   conceived at   the   news   that   came   from   India .   Ld   Lyttelton came   to   Town   on   Saturday   return'd   again   to   Sunning monday .   He   seems   well   &   thinks   he   has   benefit   from the   waters   but   intends   to   set   out   for   Hagley next   Monday   sennight .   My   late   fever   has   deterred me   from   going   to   ye   North   &   I   propose   to   go to   Sunning   to   drink   ye   waters   which   resemble the   Tunbridge   waters   which   used   to   be   of   great service   to   me   &   many   objections   rise   against Tunbridge .   Ghosts   of   departed   friends   wd   haunt me ,   Mr   West   &   Ld   Bath   used   to   compose   ye best   part   of   my   Society ,   they   exist   no   longer ,   alas , Mr   Montagu's   health   is   precarious ,   at   Sunning I   shall   be   near   Sandleford ,   he   says   he   will come   &   spend   a   few   days   with   me ,   then   I shall   make   excursions   to   return   ye   compliment to   him   at   Sandleford .   Which   I   can   reach   after drinking   ye   waters   stay   a   day   with   him &   then   return   to   the   salutary   Well ,   &   thus   I   shall help   to   amuse   him   &   at   ye   same   persue   ye scheme   of   health .   I   want   to   tempt   Mrs   Carter to   Sunning   but   she   listens   only   to   ye   voice of   duty   which   she   thinks   whispers   to   her   to make   her   Father   ye   best   of   plumb   puddings on   sundays   &   to   manage   the   rest   of   his   domestic concerns   with   careful   economy   ye   rest   of ye   week .   Our   Ministers   sit   fast   in   their   saddles tho   through   roughroad   &   some   say   very   dirty . I   hope   what   has   been   said   of   Mr   Lytteltons affronting   a   certain   Lady   is   not   true ,   he must   be   a   Monster   if   he   cd   say   any   thing to   shock   amiable   &   modesty   beauty   compelld to   put   on   a   veil   of   mystery   from   the   peculiarity of   her   situation .   He   denies   he   said   any   thing to   her   in   particular ,   nor   even   knew   her   while mask'd .   He   was   in   ye   charades   of   a   Methodist Preacher ,   &   so   told   all   people   they   were   in   a sinful   course   according   to   ye   cant   of   ye Fest ,   he   protests   he   applied   not   to   ye   Lady   however I   affirm   not   how   this   was .   Some   deny   &   others   affirm so   one   knows   not   what   to   think .   Lady   Primrose is   very   well ,   so   is   Mrs   Dunbar .   The   Pitts   have   been making   little   excursions   &   have   been   at   Hagley but   Ld   Lyttelton   was   at   Sunning .   it   is   vexatious that   he   will   leave   that   place   before   I   arrive Here   comes   Mr   Hume ,   Lady   Margt   Macdonald ,   &   I   expect an   etcetera   of   the   few   left   in   London .   I   shall   write   again   soon I   hope   you   got   my   letter   with   an   account   of   my   quite   well .   My   best   compts   to   Mrs   Hancock   &   Mr   Vesey I   am   my   Dear   Madam Ever   most   affectly   yrs E Montagu 
BC_1769_EMONTAGU_EV_4	Sandleford   ye     of   Oct   /   My   Dear   Friend   my   beloved   Sylph It   is   so   long   since   I   had   the   pleasure   of writing   to   my   Dear   Mrs   Vesey ,   that   I   shall   now   write her   a   book   rather   than   a   letter .   Last   monday   sennight I   left   Sunning   Hill ,   perfectly   satisfied   with   the   benefit I   had   received   there ,   &   being   indeed   in   as   good   health as   I   have   ever   enjoy'd .   This   amendment   did   not take   place   till   after   I   had   been   a   month   at   Sunning , tho   my   way   of   life   was   well   adapted   to   assist the   waters ,   as   it   was   pleasant ,   idle ,   full   of   exercise , &   sans   soucis   .   My   Dear   Mrs   Carter   staid   with   me to   the   very   moment   of   my   departure ,   then   she got   into   her   chaise   which   carried   her   to   Richmond to   Miss   Talbot ,   while   mine   brought   me   to   Sandleford I   have   since   hear'd   she   was   set   out   for   Deal ,   &   to   morrow hope   to   receive   an   account   of   her   safe   arrival there .   I   never   saw   her   so   well   as   the   whole   time she   was   at   Sunning .   She   had   less   of   the   head   ach and   her   animal   spirits   seem d   to   play   about with   more   than   usual   vivacity ,   &   considering , that   the   natural   texture   of   a   female   brain   is hardly   strong   enough   for   such   a   weight   of   learning   &   pressure of   solid   sense ,   her   head   aches   were   not   bad . As   to   your   humble   Servant   for   above   this   month past   she   has   been   in   robust   health ,   &   I   hope will   get   through   the   Winter   campaign   very well .   Having   finishd   my   Friends   &   my   own   history I   will   now   move   round   the   circle   of   our   Acquaintances Mr   &   Mrs   Pitt   were   at   Sunning   about   three   weeks , they   are   in   tolerable   spirits   again ,   &   are   continualy employ'd   in   making   their   poor   neighbours happy ,   relieving   the   sick ,   &   encouraging   the industrious .   We   dined   several   times   with   Mr &   Mrs   Dunbar   at   their   sweet   ferme   é &   we   rejoyced   much   at   the   noble   fortune   that is   fallen   to   them .   Perhaps   you   may   now   have the   pleasure   of   Mrs   Dunbars   company   at Lucan ,   for   when   I   saw   her   last   she   seem d to   think   it   not   impossible   she   might   go   to Ireland .   I   own   I   envy d   Mr   Dunbar   his   journey to   Ireland .   As   to   Ld   Blessingtons   estate ,   he was   the   Lawful   &   the   deserving   Heir ,   so   I   envyd it   not ,   but   there   is   neither   Law   nor   Reason   that entitles   him   to   go   to   Lucan   more   than   your humble   Servant .   We   dined   one   day   with   Lady Primrose   who   had   been   ill   but   was   better .   The August   Lady   Westmorland   was   with   her ,   & unluckily   brought   an   attendant   who   fell   sick &   had   like   to   have   died ,   which   must   have   given trouble   &   concern   to   Lady   Primrose .   a   few   days before   I   came   hither   I   gallop'd   over   to   Bullstrode to   breakfast   with   the   Duchess   of   Portland .   I   found her   Grace   tolerably   well ,   but   a   little   rheumatick . Mrs   Delany   with   her   in   good   health   &   spirits Mrs   Dashwood   came   during   the   short   time I   staid ,   so   if   we   had   had   the   same   faces ,   every thing   wd   have   had   the   same   face   it   had   years   ago .   The   Duchess   very   kindly   invited me   &   my   Friend   to   spend   a   week   with   her , but   I   had   been   so   long   absent   from   home I   could   not   reasonably   ask   Mr   Montagu   for such   an   indulgence .   I   have   heard   of   Lord   Lyttelton in   every   part   of   the   World   this   Summer .   Sometime he   was   at   Hagley   entertaining   foreign   Ministers &   their   Wives .   Then   I   hear d   of   him   at   Bowood , &   the   other   day   I   had   a   letter   from   him   from Hagley ,   in   which   he   expresses   great   joy   that Lady   Anglesey   gives   hopes   she   shall   soon present   him   with   a   Grand   child .   I   have   his   Lordship     Lady   You   will   think   his   application   to   Venus a   poetical   license   of   the   boldest   kind . I   intend   to   remain   here   till   the   beginning of   November ,   unless   the   winter   should   come in   with   great   severity .   As   my   Summer   passd like   a   pleasant   dream ,   &   the   London   life   is a   busy   kind   of   delirium ,   I   am   glad   to   insert between   them   that   sober   solidity   of   things   which one   finds   at   ones   Home   in   the   Country . I   wish   that   you   would   make   a   party   with Mrs   Carter   &   with   me   to   pass   a   month   at Sunning   Hill   in   the   true   gipsey   way   of   life .     sheet We   would   sometimes   seek   the   pensive   pleasures of   the   shady   forrest   &   hail   the   spirit   of   melancholly . Maesta   dí   pensieri , Nobilta   de   gli   affetti , Dell   ingegno   leggier   fermezza ,   &   tempra , Del   faticato   cuor   pace ,   ei   consiglio , De   pied   graditi   oggetti ,   e   piu   gentile lacida ?   rimembranza , Malinconia   gradita ,   a   te   consacro Quegli   stessi   pensieri Che   tu   nell   alma   mia   risvegli   ed   orni . Thus   would   we   borrow   the   what   the   Muse in   her   sweetest   saddest   plight   ,   has   address d to   holy   melancholly ,   such   as   lives   in   Sequesterd bower ,   &   shadowy   sets   off   the   face   of   things   ; Not   the   yellow   hued   cast   of   envy   &   discontent which   deforms   them .   Shakespear   says   prettily   that the   Scholars   melancholly   is   fantastical , &   certainly   between   memory   &   imagination it   presents ,   Vaghi   fantasmi   al   penseroso   ingegno Windsor   Castle   at   different   hours ,   in   different   aspects   &   in   different weather ,   used   to   suggest   different   ideas . Sometimes ,   when   the   noon   day   distinctly shew d   its   royal   splendor ,   it   brought   to ones   mind   our   Elizabeth   sitting   in   Council with   the   Burleighs   Walsinghams ,   & c planning   schemes   for   the   prosperity   of England ,   &   the   liberty   of   the   low   Countries . In   the   evenings   more   solemn   light   one fancied   one   saw   deeper   into   former   times   when   Edwd   &   his   Philippa presiding   at   ye   Banquet   with   the   Knights of   his   Institution ,   &   once   in   a   foggy   evening with   a   faint   moonlight   upon   it ,   I   imagined of   late   the   Palace   of   King   Lisuart ,   &   shoud   have calld   to   have   seen   the   wonders   of   the painted   Chamber   &   the   arch   of   loyal   Lovers as   described   in   Amadis   de   Gaul ,   if the   D-   of   C-d   had   not   rattled   by in   a   post   equipage .   He   was   so   little   like the   young   Esplandion ,   who   for   his   infant sport   lead   a   Lion   in   liesse ,   that   he   brought me   back   to   present   things   &   present   times . Heros ,   Statesmen ,   Legislators ,   disappeard to   make   room   for   Stockjobbers ,   Nabob   catchers , Factious   Patriots ,   &   unskilfull   ministers . I   am   afraid   we   shall   have   a   turbulent   winter as   to   politicks .   I   saw   our   friend   Burke about   a   month   ago   when   I   was   in   Town for   a   day   or   two .   He   was   going   to   Lord Rockinghams ,   to   encourage ,   I   presume , the   Yorkshire   petition .   He   was   vastly agreable   &   chearfull ,   &   I   hope   is   not   such a   loser   by   India   stock   as   is   supposed . I   hate   to   think   that   such   a   Brute   &   Barbarian as   Heyder   Ally   shddemolish   the   fortune   of one   of   the   finest   &   most   accomplishd   men in   polite   Europe .   Pray   have   you   read   l'histoire de   Francois   premier   by   Monsr   Galliard it   follows   properly   Robertsons   Charles   ye   &   tho   not   written   with   such   dignity   of style ,   grace   of   manner ,   &   that   deep   &   sober thought   which   constitute   the   highest perfection   of   History .   Yet   you   will   find   ye   a   Man   of   good   judgment ,   great candor ,   &   integrity   of   heart .   As   a   Catholick , he   deals   more   freely   with   ye   Character of   Luther ,   but   he   abhors   persecution   & only   throws   a   strong   light ,   not   a   false one ,   on   ye   characters   of   ye   Reformers . Their   excesses   &   infirmities   do   not   do   any real   prejudice   to   the   Reformation . Th'   eternal   art   educing   good   from   ill generaly   brings   ye   greatest   benefits   from men   who   had   not   perhaps   the   best   intentions Passions   operate   more   violently   than principles   &   virtues ,   &   every   truly   good Man   is   afraid   of   violent   measure   in   such sacred   things   as   Religion   &   Government . I   realy   thing   this   book   wd   amuse   you it   consists   of     small   Volumes   What   a   long letter   is   this . Ld   Lyttelton   verses   will   attone   for   my very     prose .   Compts   to   Mr   Vesey   &   Mrs   Hancock 
BC_1769_EMONTAGU_FB	Sandleford   ye     of   Oct My   Dear   Madam Too   tender   sympathy   with   my   Dear   Dear   Friend has   made   me   unable   &   afraid   to   write   to   her .   I   flatter   myself we   think   alike   upon   many   subjects ,   I   am   sure   we   did upon   one .   Except   poor   Lady   Margt   Macdonalds   I   confess I   know   not   ye   single   loss   like   yours ;   but   tho   your   tender &   generous   mind   wd   take   pleasure   only   in   the   felicities   of others ,   yet   it   will   take   patience   in   considering   &   comparing yr   lot   with   ye   shocks   which   flesh   is   Heir   to ,   &   have   befallen many .   My   Friend   Mrs   Ord   brought   two   blooming   daughters to   dine   with   me   ye   end   of   april ,   before   ye   end   of   july they   were   dead   of   consumptions ,   in   like   manner   two years   before   she   lost   ye   loveliest   &   most   beautiful   girl about     years   old   that   I   almost   ever   beheld .   Nor   is the   past   affliction   ye   worst ,   the   disorder   being   an   internal decay ,   she   lives   in   daily   apprehension   to   see   her   other branches   wither   in   their   Spring .   You   know   how   unfortunate Lady   Charlotte   Finch   has   already   been .   Her   only   Son ,   just   now possess d   of   Estate ,   title ,   every   thing   her   ambition   could desire   for   him ,   or   her   virtue   &   goodness   desire   in   him , now   in   the   very   bloom   of   all   this   happiness   she   must   hasten to   Nice   in   poor   &   scanty   hopes   to   save   him   from   his   Sisters   fate .   Miss Harriot   Finch   seems   continualy   threatend   by   a   consumption , &   Miss   Sophia   is   not   pass d   ye   dangerous   age   for   that   distemper What   has   happend   my   Dear   Friend   cannot   alarm   you for   your   other   Children ,   which   is   a   grievous   aggravation as   in   the   Cases   I   have   mention d .   Yet   there   is   a   case   even worse   than   all   this ,   Which   is   that   of   having   a   worthless Child .   We   know   a   very   good   Man   who   has   ye   Vices &   follies   of   an   only   Son   to   weep   over   &   blush   for   every day ,   for   every   day   it   is   a   new   affliction ,   being   renewd in   some   fresh   instance .   This   World   is   a   Vale   of   tears ,   but we   are   only   travellers   through   it ;   In   that   to   which   we advance ;   &   in   which   we   are   to   abide ,   all   tears   shall be   wiped   for   ever   from   all   eyes .   There   we   shall   find   what   we   have lost ,   we   shall   join   that   from   which   we   have   been   seperated , so   let   us   not   sorrow   as   those   who   have   no   hope !   I   am glad   you   are   going   to   London .   I   hope   you   will   let   your friends   come   &   sit   with   you   for   an   hour   or   two   on   an evening .   I   am   most   truly   rejoyced   that   ye   amiable   Duchess is   going   home   so   happily   recoverd .   I   sent   Mrs   Carter   back in   better   health   than   I   had   ever   seen   her ,   &   the   waters of   Sunning   seemd   to   have   given   her   more   than   usual spirits   but   a   visit   she   made   to   Mrs   &   Miss   Talbot   at Richmond   wd   I   fear   damp   those   spirits ,   for   poor   Miss Talbot   seems   declining   very   fast .   Mrs   Carter   happily   flatters herself   that   ye   case   is   not   so   bad   as   I   must   own   it appears   to   me .   To   Miss   Talbot   death   will   be   a   consummation devoutly   to   be   wishd ,   as   she   will   then   receive   the   reward of   an   excellent   &   exemplary   life ,   but   poor   Mrs   Talbot who   at   score   will   lose   ye   prop   &   staff   of   declining   age &   will   be   left   without   connections   is   much   an   object of   pity .   Mrs   Carter   in   her   letter   yesterday   complains   of some   head   ach .   We   pass d   our   time   very   agreably   at Sunning .   &   I   think   I   have   great   reason   to   be   thankfull for   their   effect   on   my   health   as   I   am   now   perfectly well .   Mr   Montagu   is   rajeuni   .   I   dont   expect   to   grow young   again   for   that   is   a   privilege   which   seems reserved   for   the   Men .   They   are   like   Trees   which   at any   age   seem   to   put   out   fresh   leaves   female   bloom is   a   sort   of   flower ,   delicate   in   its   nature   &   short   in its   existence .   I   must   conclude   my   letter   or   shall   lose the   post .   I   beg   my   best   &   most   affectte   compts   to   Dear &   amiable   Miss   Boscawen .   I   am   my   Dear   Madam Ever   most   truly   yrs E M 
BC_1769_EMONTAGU_GL_1	Sandleford June   ye     My   Lord I   can   now   have   the   pleasure   of assuring   your   Lordship   I   am   getting   perfectly   well ; but   the   pleasure   of   being   so   is   much   allayd by   Mr   Montagu's   telling   me   you   are   indisposed . He   assures   me   you   were   growing   better ,   but   saying at   the   same   time   your   Lordship   was   suddenly preparing   for   Sunninghill   alarms   me ,   &   I beg   a   line   on   the   very   important   subject   of your   health .   I   shall   be   in   Town   in   about   a   week to   finish   many   things   I   had   left   undone   on the   supposition   I   should   so   soon   return .   I   shall stay   in   Town   a   week   or   ten   days ,   &   hope   to   have the   pleasure   of   your   company   often ,   for   the   Town is   empty ;   politicks   are   asleep ,   &   Politicians are   indulging   their   Midsummer   nights   dream in   their   woods   &   groves ,   so   that   your   Printer is   the   only   very   formidable   Competitor   of   whom   I   shall stand   in   awe .   Indeed   were   I   Lord   Lyttelton ,   I should   have   an   infinite   regard   for   a   Printer , to   you   he   is   the   Conveyer   of   a   perpetuity or   least   ninetynine ninehundred     years   lease   of   Fame .   We   little Scribblers   are   like   ye   grass   which   to   day   is ,   &   tomorrow is   cast   into   the   Oven .   The   pastry   Cook   is   sure   to inherit   our   Labours   in   a   very   short   time !   From the   wonderful   indulgence   of   the   Critical   Reviewers I   hope   my   work   will   survive   next   Christmas ; before   the   next   succeeding   some   better   Critick will   drive   me   to   take   shelter   under   minced pyes   &   twelfth   cake .   The   Courtesy   of   the   Reviewers is   prodigious ;   after   many   civil   things   they add ,   that   in   its   kind ,   it   is   as   classical   a   performance as   any   this   age   has   produced .   The   word   classical sticks   in   my   throat .   alas !   did   these   Gentlemen know   the   first   rudiments   of   ye   Authors   learning were   working   a   Sampler   what   would   they   say ! I   was   afraid   these   Reviewers   would   have   been severe ,   but   they   have   hurt   me   only   by   undeserved Commendation .   These   Reviews   are   read   by   people in   the   Country ,   so   I   hope   their   favourable   sentence will   be   of   use .   I   am   glad   to   find   they   do   not guess   the   Author ,   they   talk   of   him   till   they   make me   feel   whether   I   have   not   a   beard   on   my chin .   There   is   another   of   these   monthly   papers call d   the   Critical   Memoirs   of   the   Times ,   in which   they   commend   the   Essay ,   but   what   I am   less   obliged   to   them   for   is ,   that   they   seem to   design   to   insert   the   whole   of   it   by   degrees :   the   other monthly   papers   have   not   yet   taken   notice of   me ,   but   I   suppose   they   will   do   it ,   &   some perhaps   as   unfavorably   as   these   have   been favorable   but   is   is   of   no   great   consequence ,   for in   a   year   or   two ,   the   Reviewed   &   the   Reviewers lye   down   together   in   the   same   Oven ,   are served   at   ye   same   feast ,   &   so   pass   the   glories of   this   World .   Your   little   Godson   George   Woodhouse is   the   prettiest   boy   in   Berkshire .   Mr   Montagu arrived   on   friday .   I   grieve   at   the   departure   of my   poor   Vesey .   She   is   not   made   for   the   noisy mirth   of   Dublin ,   &   I   believe   quitted   London   with great   reluctance .   Pray   has   yr   Lordship   solicited the   Duke   of   Montagu   for   a   place   in   St   Lukes Hospital   for   the   poor   madman   you   found   in a   Cottage   in   yr   road   last   year ? My   sister   begs   to   present   her   best   compliments , &   Mr   Montagu   hopes   yr   Lordship   will   do him   the   honour   to   accept   his .   My   Bard offers   his   humble   duty .   I   shall   rejoyce   to   hear your   Lordship   is   in   health . I   am   my   Lord Your   Lordships Most   Obedt   &   faithfull   Hble   Servant Eliz   Montagu 
BC_1769_EMONTAGU_GL_2	"Sandleford   Oct   ye     My   Lord I   had   last   night   a   letter   from   Mr Black ,   deeply   lamenting   his   present   inability   to   serve your   Lordship .   He   says   if   it   shall   please   God   to   restore him   again   to   health ,   he   shall   be   very   happy   in tendering   you   his   best   services .   With   the   strongest expressions   of   regret   at   being   deprived   of   the   opportunity of   exerting   his   endeavours   to   please   &   serve   Lord Lyttelton ,   for   whose   character   he   has   the   highest reverence ,   he   sets   forth   &   bewails   to   me   his   present condition   of   health ,   which   indeed   is   very   deplorable . I   believe   a   great   deal   of   his   sufferings   arise   from nervous   disorders   &   low   spirits ,   &   I   hope   he   may get   the   better   of   them   in   time .   He   was   to   have been   married   this   Autumn   to   a   young   Woman   he is   much   in   love   with ;   but   in   his   present   state of   health   he   declines   matrimony ,   for   which   I blame   him ;   for   if   the   Nymph   is   willing   to   accept a   Valetudinarian ,   I   think   a   tender   Nurse   would be   a   great   comfort   to   him .   As   nature   form'd   us for   tender   cares   &   tender   offices ,   we   have   not that   repugnance   to   attend   on   an   Invalid   that Men ,   destined   to   other   duties ,   are   apt   to   feel . I   have   sent   you   the   verses   my   Bard   presented me   with   on   my   Birthday .   the   Harvest   home feast   was   on   that   day .   Pray   have has   your   Lordship seen   Mr   Grangers   Biographical   History   from   Egbert the   Great   to   the   Revolution ?   This   History   only   comprehend those   Persons   of   whom   there   are   engraved   portraits , so   that   the   wisest   head ,   which   Painters   &   Sculptors have   not   preserved ,   may   sink   into   oblivion   for Mr   Granger .   I   mention   the   work   chiefly   as   he   has taken   an   opportunity   to   make   an   oblique   complement to   your   Lordship ;   he   seems   to   be   an   honest good   Man ;   he   is   Vicar   of   Shiplake   in   Oxfordshire Since   I   wrote   to   your   Lordship   I   met   with   Mr Garricks   Ode   printed   in   quarto ,   with   a   preface excusing   himself   for   undertaking   the   arduous   task on   account   of   others   having   declined   it .   He   says not   any   thing   of   having   been   assisted   by   any great   Genius ,   on   the   contrary ,   seems   to   lament that   he   was   not   assisted .   What   gave   occasion   to what   your   Lordship   heard   must   be   this ,   in   the prose   Oration   spoken   not   printed   by   him   he said   many   things   in   praise   of   Shakespear   which he   borrow'd   partly   from   the   Writers   on   that   great   Genius . &   perhaps   he   might   there   say   he   had   been   assisted . I   was   told   ye   other   day   that   I   had   assisted   Mr Garrick   in   his   Ode .   He   has   made   the   Author   of   ye   Essay   a   very   handsome compliment   in   his   preface   to   his   Ode   in   these   words . "" As   some   news-paper   writers   have   illiberally   endeavoured "" to   shake   the   poetick   character   of   our   immortal   Bard , "" it   is   recommended   to   those   who   are   not   sufficiently "" establish d   in   their   dramatick   faith ,   to   peruse   a "" work   lately   publish'd ,   call'd   an   Essay   on   ye   writings ,   & c . "" by   which   they   will   with   much   satisfaction   be   convinced that   England   may   justly   boast   the   honour   of producing   the   greatest   dramatick   poet   in   the   World . As   Mr   Garrick   must   probably   suspect   who   is   the Author   of   this   Essay ,   it   was   very   handsome   in him ,   as   we   have   not   been   always   the   best   friends . I   beg   of   your   Lordship   to   burn   my   last   letter ,   as I   mention d   the   Ode   without   such   commendations as   gratitude   seems   to   require . I   am   truly   chagrined   at   Mr   Blacks   being   obliged to   disappoint   your   Lordship :   Money   in   your   hands is   virtue   &   fame   .   I   hope   Lady   Anglesey   is   proceeding happily   towards   an   event   that   will   give   joy to   many ,   &   to   be   a   publick   benefit   to   the   World   if the   little   person   inherits   the   talents   &   virtues of   it   maternal   Grandfather ;   but   if   it   should have   the   talents   without   the   virtues   it   will be   a   pernicious   creature ,   &   such   virtues   without great   talents   to   preserve   them   from   insult   & injury   would   render   ye   Possessor   unhappy   in   this   World ,   so Lady   Anglesey   is   desired   to   meditate   much   on   the excellencies   of   the   head   &   heart   of   her   Father .   Mr Montagu   desires   his   compts   .   I   am   restored   to   perfect   health   &   in great   good   humour   with   ye   waters   of   Sunning .   I   am   my   Lord   yr   most   Obd "
BC_1769_EMONTAGU_GL_3	My   Lord I   return   Mr   Grenvilles   speech   after   having   read   it   with great   delight .   I   desire   yr   Lordship   to   return   my   thanks   to him   but   I   shall   not   attempt   to   praise   it ,   for   every   period   in it   convinced   me   my   praise   is   far   below   his   acceptance .   I   long to   see   the   time   when   the   wisdom   that   dictated   what   I   read shall   be   imploy'd   in   active   measures   to   save   this   poor Country .   I   hope   I   shall   find   all   my   Friends   safe   &   well   at   my return   to   Town ,   but   indeed   a   wicked   Mob   &   a   foolish   Ministry may   produce   strange   events .   It   was   better   in   old   times ,   when the   Ministry   was   wicked   &   the   Mob   foolish .   Ministries ,   however wicked ,   do   not   fix pull   down houses ,   nor   ignorant   Mob   pull   down   Governments .   A   Mob   that   can read   &   a   Ministry   that   cannot   think   are   sadly match'd .   Pray   make   my   compts   to   the   Ladies   you   have   invited for   this   evening :   it   was   pure   malice   in   yr   Lordship   to   make such   a   partie   when   I   cd   not   be   one   of   it .   The   Chaise   is ready   to   carry   me   to   my   Nightingales ,   so   I   will   only   add   that I   beg   yr   Lordship   to   send   for   Mr   Hawkins   if   yr   leg   does not   grow   better . I   am yr   Lordships   most   Obliged   & c E M 
BC_1769_EMONTAGU_GL_4	Hillstreet   ye     Dec   My   Lord I   received   a   letter   from   your   Lordship   yesterday ,   &   half   a Buck   to   day .   I   hope   you   do   so   much   justice   to   my   taste ,   as   to believe   it   greatly   prefers   the   first   bounty .   I   desired   your Lordships   Porter   to   carry   the   hanch   of   Venison   to   poor   Miss Talbot   in   your   name .   She   is   in   a   state   of   weakness   rather   than suffering .   The   happy   prospect   of   a   better   World   makes   her amends   for   all   she   is   quitting   here .   If   the   destinies   would cut   the   thread   of   her   poor   Mothers   life   I   imagine   hers   would be   loosed   at   once ; the   thought   of   rendering   the   comfortless   season   of   old   age unhappy   to   the   Parent   who   offered   every   assistance   to   her helpless   infancy   must   be   grievous ,   &   her   gratefull   Soul   seems to   exert   all   its   efforts   to   continue   in   a   Tenement   hardly habitable .   I   felt   unspeakable   concern   for   the   loss   of   Mrs Grenville .   I   could   never   bear   to   think   of   what   poor   Mr Grenville   &   the   Children   must   feel   upon   such   a   seperation . Nature ,   birth ,   &   every   thing   seem'd   to   conspire   to   make   her the   first   Woman   of   this   Country ,   &   as   added   to that   she   was   the   best   too ,   when   can   regret   &   sorrow   cease   to   .   There   seems   always   to   me   a   disproportion   between Persons   of   great   excellence   &   the   duration   of   human   life : Fifty   years   is   enough   for   ordinary   characters ,   they   may   have finishd   their   petite   peice   by   that   time ,   &   it   is   fit   they should   quit   the   Stage   to   a   New   Harlequin   &   a   new   Soubrette .   A short   space   is   enough   for those   who   are   to   do   or   to   enjoy   silly   things .   The   part   of wisedom   &   virtue   must   always   seem   too   short   to   those   whom   it is   perform'd ,   &   the   felicity   arising   from   it   to   the   Performer allows   not   of   ennui   or   satiety .   I   am   rejoyced   to   hear   Miss Stapylton   will   shew   her   friendship   to   her   lost   friend ,   not   by unavailing   tears ,   merely ,   but   by   tender   care   of   the   Children . Miss   Stapylton   character   makes   rejoyce   in   this ,   it   will   take off   a   great   deal   of   anxiety   from   Mr   Grenville ,   &   tho   it cannot   cure   his   sorrow   it   will   soften   it .   Miss   Grenville promises   to   resemble   her   Mother ,   may   she   have   a   longer   life !   I wish   she   wd   early   accustom   herself   to   taking   rhubarb   if   she has   any   disorder   in   her   stomach ,   it   is   the   best   antidote   to her   Mothers   complaint .   However   to   speak   of   things   more chearfull .   When   will   your   Leonidas   appear ?   I   believe   your Lordship   &   I   shall   have   many   a   battle   upon   the   subject You   will   come   like   the   Persian   Monarch .   You   will   appear   in   all the   Pomp   of   Learning   with   a   vast   Muster   of   eloquence   & abundance   of   art ,   &   you   will   dazzle   by   the   brightness   of   your arms ,   &   terrify   with   the   number   of   your   Troops ,   all   the   Epick Poets   but   Homer   &   Ossian   perhaps   on   your side .   I   shall   be   a   poor   Spartan   unassisted uneloquent ,   unadorned ,   but   if   your   Poem   cannot   enter   the Straits   of   the   Heart   I   shall   be   invincible .   If   your   Poem touches   neither   the   Passions   nor   the   imagination   why   –   it   may be   very   respectable   to   be   sure ,   &   I   shall   own   to   be   a   very fine   funeral   Oration .   I   am   very   angry   at   what   you   say   of Paoli .   Good   my   Lord   are   there   are   not   dead   Heroes   &   Patriots enough   ?   the   rarity   is   to   be   a   living   one .   I should   not   have   taken   the   least   notice   of   the   Man   if   I   had   met him   in   the   Elysian   fields .   Epaminandos   wd   have   stood   before him ,   Timoleon   would   have   overtoppd   him ,   Dion   would   have   been more   conspicuous ,   but   oh !   when   he   stood   in   the   drawing   room by   the   D-   of   -   &   the   Earl   of   -   &   Lord   –   he look'd   more   than   human !   I   know   my   Patriot   is   not   likely   to   be made   an   Alderman   as   modern   Patriots   are ,   but   I   like   him   the better .   I   like   not   like   the   plum ,   nor   the   sugar   plumb   Patriot . He   shall   dye   to   please   his   vanity   another   time ,   when Corsica   can   spare   him   better .   Il   est   plus   difficile   d'etre saint   que   martire   says   a   wise   man .   if   my   Patriot continues   pure   &   holy   in   a   Court   I   shall   honour   him   more   than if   he   had   dyed   in     of   virtue . As   Lady   Anglesey   has   drunk   up   her   candle   I   wish   your Lordship   wd   come   to   Town .   It   is   a   dull   Town   I   must   confess , but   that   fault   your   Lordship   will   mend ,   &   render   it   agreable to   your   Friends .   I   am   sorry   to   tell   you   that   a   friend   of   yours is   no   longer   a   conceal'd   scribbler .   I   had   better   have   employd the   Town   Cryer   to   have proclaimed   me   an   Author ,   but   being   whisperd   it   has   circulated with   incredible   swiftness .   I   hear   Mr   Andrew   Stone   is   very indulgent   to   my   performance   which   flatters   my   vanity .   Mr Melmoth   at   Bath   puffs   me ,   but   I   am   most   flatterd   that   a Brother   Author   says   ye   book   wd   be   very   well   if   it had   not   too   much   witt .   I   thought   there   had   been   no   witt at   all   in   it ,   &   am   as   pleased   as   Mr   Jourdain   was   when   his Preceptor   told   him   he   spoke   prose .     hurts   any body   or   any   thing   it   is   chance   medley ,   no   premeditated   malice , neither   art   nor   part   has   my   will   therein .   I   dont   love   witt ,   it is   a   poor   paltry   thing   &   fit   only   for   a   Merry   Andrew .   I   look very   innocent   when   I   am   attack'd   about   the   Essay ,   &   say   I   dont know   what   they   mean .   I   shall   set   about   a   new Edition   as   soon   as   your   Lordship   comes   to   Town   for   ye   first   is   in   great   part   sold   tho   the   Booksellers   have   done   me all   ye   prejudice   in   their   power . I   was   so   provoked   at   Mr   Black   for   disappointing   you   again   I gave   him   a   good   lecture   by   ye   post .   If   ye   fences   of   your Woods   ar   not   well   kept   up   they   will   be   ruined ,   indeed   good fences   are   of   great   consequence   to   all   ground   but   most particularly   for   woods .   Mr   Black   will   certainly   be   of   use   to your   Lordship .   My   best   respects   attend   Lord   &   Lady   Anglesey ,   & affectionte   wishes   ye   little   Lord .   Of   all   my   scrowls   this   worst ,   but   by   orders   of   ye   Doctors   I   write   of   candle ,   but   I   cannot   write     of paper .   Mr   Montagu   desires   his   best   comp=ts   he   was   very desirous   MrBlack   should   attend   your   Lordship   having   found himself   should   good   consequences   from   his   care . I   am   my   Lord your   Lordships most   Obliged   Obedt Hble   Servt E Montagu Mr   Montagu   came   to   Town   to   day   he   left   my   Bard   very   well at   Sandleford 
BC_1769_EMONTAGU_MR_1	Sunning   Wells   ye     Dear   Sir You   had   the   goodness   to   intimate a   wish   to   hear   how   these   waters   agree   with   me , &   I   think   I   can   now   pronounce   that   they   have had   a   very   good   effect   upon   my   constitution . I   am   one   of   those   unfortunate   persons   continualy sick   without   a   distemper .   Neither   the language ,   nor   even   the   jargon   of   physick ,   can   ever find   a   name   for   my   disorders .   I   had   been for   a   long   time ,   according   to   the   scotch   phrase , very   unwell   .   I   am   now   in   as   good   health as   I   ever   remember   to   have   been .   My   appetite is   much   improved ,   &   I   sleep   better   than   I   did before   I   drank   these   waters .   I   pass   my   time in   a   chearful   pleasant   kind   of   idleness . The   waters   affect   the   head   so   much ,   that any   kind   of   application   is   improper ,   therefore one   stands   in   need   of   some   society ;   &   I   am   very fortunately   situated   in   that   respect ,   as   some of   my   most   intimate   acquaintance   are   in this   Neighborhood ,   so   that   I   have   continual invitations   to   dine   with   some   of   them .   In the   morning   the   small   party   of   waterdrinkers meet   at   the   Well ,   when   we   are   tired   of   walking there   is   a   Room   where   we   rest ,   it   is   rarely that   more   than   half   a   dozen   are   ever assembled   together ,   but   notwithstanding   all the   Foreigners   say   of   the   English   taciturnity , a   very   few   people   will   keep   up   a   sort   of chitt   chatt ,   which   is   sufficient   to   fill   the   half hours   interval   between   the   glasses   of   water . Every   monday   there   is   a   publick   breakfast   & a   Ball ,   &   on   wensday   evenings   a   card assembly .   Being   a   middleaged   Woman ,   I   can neither   partake   of   ye   dancing   which   is   one of   the   joys   of   youth ,   nor   assist   at   ye   card playing   which   is   among   the   chief   comforts   of age ,   so   I   pass   these   hours   in   taking   my airings   if   I   am   not   engaged   at   the   Houses   of my   Friends ;   for   there   is   an   air   of   pride   or ill   nature   in   appearing   to   chuse   not   to   mix in   the   diversions   which   are   going   forward if   one   is   in   the   way   of   them .   I   am   but   miles   from   Sandleford ,   &   on   wensday   last , after   drinking   the   waters ,   I   got   into   my post   chaise   to   make   a   visit   to   Mr   Montagu , &   staid   with   him   till   saturday .   I   had   the pleasure   of   finding   him   very   well ,   &   he promises   to   return   my   visit   on   thursday &   to   bring   little   Matt   with   him .   Mr   Montagu will   spend   only   a   few   days   here ,   but   I   hope   he will   receive   some   amusement   from   taking airings   to   Windsor   &   in   the   Forrest .   I   am   to carry   Mrs   Carter   to   Windsor   Castle   tomorrow in   our   way   to   Lady   Frances   Coningesbyes   where we   are   to   dine .   I   had   the   pleasure   of   attending my   Sister   to   the   Castle ,   but   tho   I   have   visited it   so   often   I   always   see   it   with   pleasure . It   is   a   noble   Monument   of   the   wealth   &   greatness of   our   Antient   Kings ,   it   has   not   indeed   the elegance   of   Grecian   Architecture   but   the vastness ,   strength ,   &   solidity   of   the   Building render   it   respectable :   I   am   surprized   our Sovereigns   have   so   long   neglected   this   Castle which   seems   the   noblest   residence   for   the Chief   Magistrate   of   a   great   &   free   Country . It   is   sufficiently   superior   to   our   other   Edifices to   command   reverence   &   respect ,   &   seems design d   rather   as   an   hospitable   retreat &   safe   asylum   to   those   who   would   resort to   their   Sovereign ,   than   like   other   Castles , to   wear   an   air   of   hostile   defiance   to   terrify or &     in   timerous   subjection   the   Country around   it .   The   prospect   in   view   offers   the most   smiling   aspect   of   Peace   &   liberty ,   &   tho the   Thames ,   in   this   part ,   neither   carrys   out the   thunder   of   War ,   nor   assists   in   distant Commerce ,   but   is   imployed   in   fertilizing the   Vallies   through   which   he   glides   however even   here   we   consider   him   as   more   noble than   any   other   River .   We   behold   him ,   like a   great   Statesman   &   Warrior   in   his   rural   retirement . We   respect   him   for   the   naval   Victories   he has   assisted   in   obtaining   for   his   Country , &   the   Commerce   with   which   he   has   enriched it .   I   always   think   Windsor ,   Eton ,   &   their environs ,   are   the   best   panegyricks   on   our Plantagenets ,   as   the   wide   waste   of   Heath &   Forrest   in   this   part   of   the   World   is   the severest   censure   on   the   Tyranny   of   William Rufus .   In   those   rude   ages ,   in   this   unpolishd Land ,   Kings   had   not   learn'd   that   Men   in Walled   Citties   may   be   made   as   much   their prey   as   Beasts   in   the   Forrest ,   &   may   be   taken in   the   toils   of   political   institutions   as   easily as   the   Wolves   &   Bears   in   the   Hunters   net .   If Rufus   had   had   a   Machiavel   for   his   Minister he   wd   have   encouraged   building   Towns   instead of   destroying   them ,   &   for   by   the   allurements   of pleasure ,   &   baits   thrown   out   to   avarice   or   luxury Men   are   ever   to   be   caught ,   if   they   have   been soften'd   &   civilized   by   Society . I   took   the   liberty   to   send   you   a   trout   the other   day ,   it   had   been   taken   but   a   few hours   before   it   was   sent   away ,   but   it   travelld in   so   hot   a   day   I   am   much   afraid   it   might not   be   so   fresh   as   I   wishd .   I   hope   you   have had   uninterrupted   health   since   I   left   you .   I   flatter myself   that   you   will   take   a   trip   to   Bath by   which   means   I   shall   get   some   hours   of yr   company   at   Newbury   &   at   Sandleford . Mrs   Carter   desires   her   compts .   With   perfect   respect I   am   Dear   Sir Your   most   affectionate And   Dutifull   Daughter E Montagu 
BC_1769_EMONTAGU_MR_2	Sunning   Wells Sunday   morn Sir My   vanity   has   been   exceedingly flatter'd ,   by   hearing ,   that   a   small   performance of   mine   in   the   Critical   way   has   met   with   your approbation .   whatever   share   of   that   approbation   I   must attribute   to   partiality ,   tho'   the   Author   dare   not be   vain     the   Daughter   feels   a   still   higher pleasure   from   it .   The   only   abatement   of   my   pleasure on   this   occasion   is ,   least   you   should   imagine   my not   having   communicated   this   affair   has   some air   or   appearance   of   disrepect ;   &   as   you   both encouraged   &   cultivated   those   little   talents Nature   bestowed   on   me ,   I   should   appear   ungratefull as   well   as   undutiful   if   you   look'd   upon my   reserve   in   that   light .   I   will   therefore   take the   liberty   to   explain   some   of   my   reasons   for the   secresy   with   which   I   acted   on   this   occasion . In   the   first   place ,   there   is   in   general ,   a   prejudice against   female   Authors   especialy   if   they   invade   those regions   of   litterature   which   the   Men   are   desirous to   reserve   to   themselves .   While   I   was   young ,   I   should not   have   liked   to   have   been   class'd   among Authors ,   but   at   my   age   it   is   less   unbecoming . If   an   old   Woman   does   not   bewitch   her   Neighbors Cows ,   nor   make   any   girl   in   the   Parish spit   crooked   pins ,   the   World   has   no   reason   to take   offence   at   her   amusing   herself   with   reading   books or   even   writing   them .   However   some   circumstances in   this   particular   case   advise   secresy .   Mr   Pope our   great   Poet ,   the   Bishop   of   Gloucester   our Great   Critick ,   &   Dr   Johnson   our   great   Scholar , having   already   given   their   criticism   upon Shakespear ,   there   was   a   degree   of   presumption in   pretending   to   meddle   with   a   subject   they   had   already treated   Sure   to   incur   their   envy   if   I   succeded tolerably   well ,   their   contempt   if   I   did   not .   Then   for a   weak   &   unknown   Champion   to   throw   down the   gauntlett   of   defiance   in   the   very   teeth of   Voltaire   appear'd   too   daring .   The   french   &   Italians are   fond   of   books   of   Criticism ,   but   they   are   not too   much   to   the   taste   of   the   English .   At   present   too the   desire   of   most   Readers   is   to   be   amused   with something   perfectly   gay   &   superficial .   I   was   obliged to   enter   seriously   into   the   nature   of   the   Dramatick purposes ,   &   the   character   of   the   best   dramatick writings ,   &   by   sometimes   differing   from   the Code   of   the   great   Legislator   in   Poeticks ,   Aristotle , I   was   afraid   the   Learned   would   reject   my opinions ,   the   unlearned   yawn   over   my   pages , so   that   I   was   very   doubtfull   of   the   general   success of   my   work .   The   booksellers   who   hate   an   Author should   print   for   himself ,   would   hardly   advertise my   book .   The   Adventures   of   M:   Macflurtey   & the   life   of   Miss   Eliza   Musgrove   were   advertised long   before   they   appear'd   in   every   paper . It   is was   with   great   difficulty   I   got   my   Essay advertised   the   day   before   it   was   publishd , &   in   spite   of   all   my   pains   it   hardly   appeard in   the   papers   till   ye   week   after   ye   Kings birthday   when   the   Town   was   empty ,   so   that   all these   disadvantages   considerd ,   I   could   not   flatter myself   this   little   work   wd   succeed   so   well   as it   has   done :   if   it   remain'd   in   obscurity   as appear d   to   me   too   probable ,   it   wd   only   have been   a   mortification   to   my   Friends   &   tho   not being   absurd   it   could   not   disgrace ,   being neglected ,   it   could   not   do   me   honour ,   therefore I   communicated   the   affair   only   to   three   or four   Persons   conversant   in   Critical   learning , who   I   thought   it   necessary   to   consult   before   I ventured   to   publish ,   as   it   is   unsafe   to   trust   ones own   judgment   as   to   the   merit   of   ones   own   composition . The   Critical   Reviewers   &   other   Monthly   Writers   have done   much   more   than   justice   to   my   little   work ,   &   it   is now   printing   at   Dublin ,   to   ye   increase   of   its   fame but   to   ye   prejudice   of   my   profit   as   an   Author . I   must   tell   you ,   my   confidantes   in   this   affair kept   ye   secret   very   faithfully ,   &   diverse   Persons were   named   as   ye   Author   of   the   Essay ,   &   all   such as   did   honour   to   it ,   but   some   persons   who   were acquainted   with   my   manner   of   expression   or   style , if   so   careless   a   Writer   may   be   said   to   have   a   style , guess'd   at   me ;   great   enquiries   were   made   of ye   Booksellers ,   who   said   they   knew   not   the   Author : all   they   knew   was ,   great   pains   had   been   taken to   conceal   him   .   The   Printer   at   last   unluckily   ownd that   Mr   Stillingfleet   corrected   the   Press ,   &   as   he is   an   intimate   friend   of   mine   this   circumstance has   in   some   degree   betray d   ye   secret .   I   shall   not own   the   work ,   nor   would   have   any   of   my   friends own   it   is   mine ,   but   leave   people   to   think   as they   please :   I   am   content   to   be   a   demirep   in litterature ,   but   cannot   have   the   effronterie   to go   further .   Voltaire   is   very   malicious   as   well as   very   witty ,   I   care   little   for   his   censure   of   the Work ,   but   wd   not   have   him   abuse   ye   Author . If   he   provokes   me ,   I   will   take   my   revenge upon   his   Dramatical   works .   I   have   thought   myself very   fortunate   that   the   pert   News   writers   have not   sneered   at   the   Lady   Critick .   If   this   work   lives to   a   second   edition ,   I   hope   to   present   it   to   you   improved for   it   is   very   ill   printed ,   &   with   many   blunders .   I   do not   affect   to   apologize   for   any   faults   in   the   writing by   saying   it   was   done   carelessly   or   in   haste , for   indeed   I   took   a   great   deal   of   pains   about   it , especialy   to   make   it   short ,   as   people   are   apt   to complain   of   ye   dullness   &   dryness   of   Criticism . My   Vacant   hours   were   agreably   fill'd   by   this occupation ,   &   whenever   I   have   health   &   leisure I   shall   employ   it   in   composition   of   some   sort or   another .   If   I   had   lived   in   the   same   age   with Pope ,   Addison ,   &   Swift ,   &   some   others   of   that   time , I   should   never   have   brandish d   my   grey   goose quill ,   but   in   our   times   a   middling   writer   may expect   a   share   of   fame ,   which   is   now   rather divided   in   small   parcels   amongst   many ,   than engrossed   by   any   superlative   genius's .   I   ask   pardon for   saying   so   much   of   my   little   self ,   &   my   little book ,   but   wish'd   much   to   have   an   opportunity of   explaining   to   you   the   reasons   why   I   was so   reserved   on   the   subject .   Mr   Montagu   came here   &   stay'd   a   week ,   he   left   me   on   Friday .   I   had a   slight   return   of   ye   disorder   I   complaind   of   in the   Spring ,   but   had   not   any   fainting   fit   or   fever . I   was   ill   for   about   an   hour ,   &   turn'd   yellow   as before ,   tho   in   a   less   degree ,   but   my   appetite   & spirits   are   better ,   &   the   waters   agree   well   with   me . I   was   very   glad   to   hear   from   my   Brother   Morris that   you   are   got   well   again .   Mrs   Carter   desires her   best   respects . I   am   Dear   Sir Your   most   affectte   and most   Dutiful   Daughter E   Montagu As   the   jubilee   has   awakend ye   love   of   ye   publick   to   Shakespear I   have   written   a   note   to   Dodsley   from the   Author   of   ye   Essay   to   desire   it   may   be   advertized again .   I   shall   be   much   obliged   to   Mrs   Hawking   if she   will   put   it   into   ye   penny   post .   ye   farther   from Hillstreet   it   is   put   in   ye   better ,   for   I   wd   not   have Master   Dodsley   smell   out   ye   Author .   I   did   not   care to   trust   my   porter   with   ye   note   to   Dodsley .   Since I   wrote   this   postscript   I   have   hit   on   a   surer way   to   have   my   work   advertized   than   by sending   to   Dodsley   who   perhaps   might   neglect it . 
BC_176x_EMONTAGU_EV_1	before   If   I   had   been   well   enough   to   go   out   I   should   have   told   you in   person   how   much   I   am   rejoyced   Mr   Vesey   is   so   much better ,   and   I   wish'd   to   make   a   proposal   to   you   by   word of   mouth   which   I   shall   do   by   billet .

BC_1770_EMONTAGU_EC_1	Denton   ye     of   aug: My   Dear   friend Last   night   at   my   arrival   at   this   place I   found   my   dear   friends   letter .   I   had   not   been   able to   write   to   her   on   the   road ,   my   head   was   so   giddy with   ye   incessant   rolling   of   my   postchaise .   I   am excessively   rejoyced   Dr   Carter   is   well   again .   I   repented that   I   had   not   told   you   where   to   direct   an   account of   him   upon   the   road ,   for   I   was   very   anxious   about him .   I   was   half   dead   with   hurry   ye   few   days   I   was in   Town ,   my   journey   has   done   me   good ,   tho   it   is tiresome   enough   to   be   for   ever   in   motion .   I   stopp'd two   days   &   an   half   at   Mr   Smelts   in   Yorkshire &   passd   my   time   most   agreably   there .   Vesey   &   yr Hble   Servant   love   seeing   places   immoderately ,   so all   weary   as   I   was ,   I   got   Mr   Smelt   to   carry   me to   see   a   Romantick   place   of   Mr   Aislabies     miles from   his   house ,   &   well   it   answerd   my   trouble , but   I   cannot   now   describe   it .   Mr   Smelts   place   is ill   situated   for   posts ,   so   I   intended   writing   to   you   from Durham ,   but   Mr   Archdeacon   came   to   meet   me there   &   I   could   not   in   civility   leave   him   to   amuse himself   with   his   own   thoughts .   Susans   Lover ,   & Edwd   Brown , me   ,   all   dressd   in   their   best   apparel   &   well   mounted on   our   Colliery   horses ,   &   to   see   them   all   look happy   pleased   me .   Allinson   to   be   sure   was   most blest   with   ye   sight   of   his   Love ,   but   Edwd   Brown , who   thought   I   shd   approve   his   diligent   &   faithfull Services   here ,   &   Natt   who   look'd   upon   me   on   ye light   of   a   good   farm ,   for   he   is   married   &   expects I   shd   settle   him   on   this   estate ,   had   Countenances that   express d   great   delight .   Mr   Archdeacon   seemd very   glad   to   see   me ,   &   when   I   got   here   many congratulatory   Countenances   presented   themselves . Nothing   could   so   strongly   signify   they   had   behaved well   in   my   absence   as   ye   joy   express d   at   my return ,   &   I   pity   those   whose   pride   or   insensibility deprives   them   of   sharing   in   the   sentiments   of their   dependants .   Indeed   the   order   in   which   I find   every   thing   relative   to   ye   estate   &   Colliery is   very   pleasant .   The   Colliery   has   now   ye   most trade   of   any   except   Long   Benton ,   &   it   works to   more   profit   from   its   situation   than   any   on the   River ,   so   tho   ye   trade   in   general   is   bad ,   we have   of   all   people   least   reason   to   complain . I   left   Mr   Montagu   in   pretty   good   health   &   very good   spirits .   My   Sister   is   so   good   as   to   stay   with him .   He   talks   of   coming   here   soon .   I   have   been obliged   to   write   a   long   detail   of   affairs   here   to Mr   Montagu ,   &   I   must   write   to   Mr   Black   & our   agent   at   Billingsgate ,   so   to   another   post   I must   reserve   much   I   have   to   say .   I   have also   had   a   letter   from   Vesey   who   reproaches   me   I did   not   write   to   her .   If   I   had   I   must   have   sent Will   o'   the   wisp   with   my   letter   after   such   a scampering   body .   I   had   fully   intended   being blooded   at   London   but   as   it   happened   it   was not   necessary .   I   had   ye   rheumatism   in   my   face again   just   before   I   set   out   from   London .   I   am   my dear   friend   ever   yours   most   affectly E:   Montagu 
BC_1770_EMONTAGU_EC_2	July   ye   My   dear   friend I   am   sure   you   will   be   glad   to hear   that   my   health   is   more   confirmd ,   & that   I   am   now   as   well   as   usual .   The   poor   Man who   presided   over   our   Collieries   is   dead ,   &   as we   had   long   no   hope   of   his   recovery ,   &   he sufferd   grievous   pain ,   the   last   stroke   seemd a   deliverance   rather   than   a   misfortune . I   have   had   less   to   do ,   as   during   his   sickness many   things   were   suspended ,   but   now we   shall   have   trouble   in   finding   him a   proper   Successor   of   settling   him   in   his business .   I   have   taken   care   not   to   put   too much   trust   in   any   of   the   Persons   employd , for   temptations   operating   on   human frailty   are   very   dangerous .   The   Ship   is not   come   from   Deal   for   our   Coals ,   but the   winds   I   believe   have   been   adverse . I   am   rejoyced   that   Mrs   Hancock   is   better she   is   a   very   valuable   Woman ,   &   I   love   her for   her   own   sake ,   but   should   be   still   more concernd   at   her   death   for   the   sake   of our   sylph ,   whose   material   habitation is   on   the   person   of   Mrs   Hancock ;   was   that good   Woman   out   of   ye   World ,   Vesey   wd flit   about   in   ye   air   like   a   feather escaped   from   the   Wing   of   a   fowl ;   from that   hour   I   would   wear   an   amber necklace   or   bracelet   in   order   to   attract her ,   but   I   might   sometimes   have the   mortification   of   seeing   her   drawn   away by   the   prevalence   of   an   amber   headed cane   in   snuff   box .   Mr   B-   is   one   of those   wise   men   who   desire   to   love poor   for   the   honour   of   dying   rich .   It is   an   odd   thing   that   his   Wife   has   by no   means   avoided   poverty   by   marrying a   man   of   L   a   year .   I   am   very   happy to   find   that   one   long   journey   has   mended Mrs   Chapones   health ,   &   I   hope   it   will have   a   lasting   good   effect .   The   weather   has been   such ,   that   I   have   not   been   able to   give   her   any   amusement   more   than a   tame   airing .   We   went   yesterday morning   to   her   Cousin   Dr   Ogles ,   staid two   hours ,   &   return d   to   dinner ,   for I   was   afraid   of   being   abroad   at   dinner time   on   account   of   missing   people   of business   who   might   possibly   call   on me .   We   are   all   going   to   day   to   dine at   Mr   Archdeacons ,   where   we   are   to meet   a   great   many   Newcastle   Gentlemen &   Ladies .   I   desire   that   you   will   make my   best   compliments   to   Lord   &   Lady   Camden &   the   young   Ladies .   I   dare   say   his   Lordship enjoys   with   delight   that   leisure   it   is   a   loss   to   the World   he   should   possess ,   as   his   mind was   above   his   business   he   can   substute noble   &   rational   employments   in   the room   of   it .   A   little   mind   accustom'd   to a   routine   of   employments   is   wonderfully at   a   loss   when   put   of   its   wanted course .   I   hear   Lord   Worthington   has been   in   Town   beating   up   for   Ministerial reemits ,   but   neither   list   money ,   nor all   he   could   say ,   or   swear ,   wd   prevail . I   hate   to   think   of   the   vast   distance there   is   between   us   at   present ,   it   makes absence   which   is   always   grievous   frightful .   I   hear   that   my   Bror   Morris his   Wife ,   &   my   sweet   little   Matt   are   going into   Kent .   I   have   enclosed   the   history   of   Mrs   Monro   at   ye   desire   of   Mrs Chapone ,   who   thinks   it   might   be of   benefit   to   ye   poor   if   Ld   Dartrce   who is   related   to   her   Husband   was   made acquainted   with   her   situation .   Pray   forget not   my   compts   to   Dr   Carter   &   all   your   family &   my   Friend   Mrs   Underdown .   Mrs   Chapone is   much   your   Humble   Servt   entirely   Yours E Montagu 
BC_1770_EMONTAGU_EV	Hillstreet   Nov   ye   Has   not   my   dear   Sylph   full   often heard   that   hope   defer'd   maketh   the   heart sick ?   Ever   since   you   left   us   what   have   I wish'd   for   but   your   return !   Ever   since   the month   of   Septber   what   have   I   expected   but your   arrival .   You   come   not   till   october   &   then you   go   to   Bath .   I   came   to   Hillstreet   on   thursday last   from   the   North   with   as   much   warmth of   friendship   as   if   I   had   drop'd   out   of   Comet &   expected   to   find   you   in   the   blue   room , but   I   am   told   you   are   bathing   in   hot   water . Pray   don't   make   water   succhi   of   yourself the   air   is   rather   your   element   than water .   You   are   most   unlike   to   the   fat waddling   duck   of   any   creature   upon   Earth &   yet   you   are   always   swimming .   Sometimes in   hot   sometimes   cold   sometimes   salt   water . Mrs   Carter   wont   leave   Deal   while   you   stay at   Bath .   Lord   Lyttelton   wont   grow   fat ,   &   I shall   not   look   rosy   while   you   are   there ,   nor before   you   arrive   here   will   party   animosity subside ,   Ministers   cease   to   be   servile   or opposers   to   be   factious .   How   can   you   live   with any   content   at   Bath   while   we   are   all in   confusion   here ,   come   &   compose   all   differences of   all   parties   or   if   you   cannot   enjoy   the bustle .   The   Town   will   be   very   lively   this winter   between   the   bill   of   rights   Gentlemen &   the   Coterie   ladies .   The   zealous   friends   of liberty   intend   to   bring   a   bill   into   Parliamt to   give   leave   for   these   choice   spirits   to enjoy   free   liberty   to   cohabit   in   such   sort as   may   give   reasonable   hopes   of   a continuance   of   posterity   of   these ornaments   of   their   Country . I   had   ye   pleasure   of   seeing   Mr   Burke this   morning .   I   find   Mr   de   Grey   is   not Lord   Keeper .   Poor   Mr   Grenvilles   death   has thrown   a   damp   on   his   party .   I   have   not seen   Lord   Lyttelton   since   this   melancholy event   which   will   touch   him   very   nearly . I   have   had   a   very   bad   state   of   health   almost ever   since   you   left   us   but   I   am   now much   better .   I   have   been   a   remiss   correspondent not   from   choice   but   writing   has   a very   bad   effect   upon   my   stomach   &   I   am forbidden   by   my   Doctors   even   to   write . I   rejoyce   to   think   I   may   soon   hope   to converse   with   my   dear   Sylph   without pen   &   ink .   I   beg   my   best   compts   to   Mrs Handcock .   Where   is   Mr   Vesey ?   Lady Shelburne   is   charm'd   with   Lucan . I   am   my   dear   Madam Ever   most   affectly   yrs E Montagu 
BC_1770_EMONTAGU_MA	Hillstreet   Nov   ye     Dear   Madam Your   kind   letter   met   me   in   Hillstreet   on   thursday ,   it welcomed   me   to   London   in   a   very   agreable   manner .   I   should however   have   felt   a   painful   consciousness   how   little   I deserved   such   a   favour ,   if   my   long   omission   of   correspondence had   not   been   owing   to   want   of   health .   I   fell   ill   on   my   journey to   Denton ,   or   rather   indeed   began   the   journey   indisposed ,   & only   aggravated   my   complaints   by   travelling .   Sickness   &   bad weather   deprived   me   of   the   pleasure   of   seeing   the   beauties   of Derbyshire ,   however   I   got   a   sight   of   the   stately   Palace   of Lord   Scarsdale ;   where ,   the   arts   of   antient   Greece ,   &   the delicate   pomp   of   modern   ages ,   unite   to   make   a   most   magnificent habitation .   It   is   the   best   worth   seeing   of   any   House   I   suppose in   England ,   but   I   know   how   it   is ,   that   one   receives   but moderate   pleasure   in   the   works of   art .   There   is   a   littleness   in   every   work   of   Man .   The operations   of   Nature   are   vast   &   noble ,   &   I   found   much   greater pleasure   in   the   contemplation   of   Lord   Breadalbans   Mountains , rocks ,   &   Lakes ,   than   in   all   the   efforts   of   human   art   at   Lord Scarsdales .   I   continued   after   my   arrival   at   Denton   in   a   very poor   state   of   health ,   which   suited   ill   with   continual business ,   and   made   me   unable   to   write   letters   in   the   hours   of recess   &   quiet .   Dr   Gregory   came   from   Edinburgh   to   make   me   a visit ,   &   perswaded   me   to   ye   Coach   with   him .   the   scheme promised   much   pleasure ,   &   I   flatterd   myself   might   be   conducive to   health ,   as   the   Doctor ,   of   whose   medical   skill   I   have   the highest   opinion ,   would   have   time   to   observe   and   consider   my various   complaints .   I   was   glad   also   to   have   an   opportunity   of amusing my   friend   Mrs   Chapone ,   who   I   carried   into   the   North   with   me . We   had   a   pleasant   journey   to   Edinburgh ,   where   we   were   most agreably   entertain'd   in   Doctor   Gregorys   house .   All   the litterati   &   the   polite   company   at   Edinburgh   paying   me   all   kind of   attentions ,   &   by   the   Doctors   regimen   my   health   improved greatly ,   so   that   I   was   prevaild   upon   to   indulge   my   love   of prospects   by   another   trip   to   the   Highlands .   My   good   friend   & Physician   still   attending   me .   The   first   days   journey   was   to Lord   Barging   Brother   to   Mr   Charles   Ereskine , who   was   the   intimate   companion   &   friendly   competitor   of   my poor   Brother   Tom ,   each   of   them   was   qualified   for   the   highest honour   of   their   profession ,   which   they   wd   have   certainly attain'd   had   it   pleased   God   to   have   granted   longer   life .   Ld Barging   had   received   great   civilities   at Horton   when   he   was   persuing his   law   studies   in   England ,   so   he   came   to   visit   me   as   soon   as I   got   to   Edinburgh ,   &   in   the   most   friendly   manner   press'd   my passing   some   days   at   his   house   in   Perth   &   here .   I   got   there   by an   easy   days   journey   after   having   also   walk'd   a   long   time about   the   Castle   of   Stirling ,   which   commands   a   very   beautiful prospect .   Lord   Bargings   place   is   very   fine ,   &   in   a   very singular   style .   His   house   looks   to   ye   South   over   a   very   rich Valley ,   renderd   more   fertile   as   well   as   more   beautiful   by   the meanderings   of   the   River   Forth .   behind   his   House   rise   great Hills   coverd   with   Wood ,   &   over   them   stupendous   rocks .   The Goats   look   down   with   an   air   of   philosophical   pride &   gravity   on   folks   in   the   Valley .   One   in   particular   seem'd   to me ,   capable   of   addressing   the   famous   beast   of   Gevan/dun   if he   had   been   there   with   as   much disdain   as   Diogenes   did   the   great   Conqueror   of   the   East .   Here I   passd   two   days   very   agreably ,   &   then   his   Lordship   &   my Doctor   attended   me   to   my   old   friend   Ld   Kinnouls .   You   may imagine   my   visit   there   gave   me   a   great   deal   of   pleasure   beside what   arose   from   seeing   a   fine   place .   I   was   delighted   to   find an   old   friend   enjoying   that   heartfull   happiness   which   attends a   life   of   virtue .   Lord   Kinnoul   is   continually   employd   in encouraging   agriculture   &   manufactures ,   protecting   the   weak from   injury ,   assisting   ye   distress'd ,   &   animating   the   young people   to   whatever   in   their   various   stations   is   most   fit   & proper .   He   appears   more   happy   in   the   situation   than   when   he was   whirled   about   in   the   Vortex   of   the   Duke   of   Newcastle .   The situation   of   a   Scottish   Nobleman   of   fortune   is   enough   to   fill the   ambition   of   a   reasonable   man for   they   have   power   to   do   a   great   deal   of   good .   From   Dupplain we   went   to   Lord   Breadalbane   at   Faymouth .   Here   unite the   Sublime   &   beautiful     The House   is   situated   in   a   Valley   where   the   verdure   is   the   finest imaginable ,   &   noble   beeches   adorn   it ,   &   beautiful   cascades fall   down   the   midst   of   it ;   through   this   Valley   you   are   led   to a   Vast   Lake ,   on   one   side   the   Lake   there   is   a   fine   Country ,   on the   other   Mountains   lift   their   heads   &   hide   them   in   the Clouds ,   in   some   places   ranges   of   Rocks   look   like   vast fortifyed   Cittadels .   I   passd   two   days   in   this   fine   place   where I   was   entertaind   with   the   greatest   politeness   &   kindest attentions .   Lord   Breadalbane   seeming   to   take   the   greatest pleasure   in   making   every   thing   easy ,   agreable ,   &   convenient . My   next   excursion   was   to   Lord   Kaimes's ,   &   then   I   returnd   to Edinburgh .   With   Lord   Kaimes   &   his   Lady   I   have   had   a correspondence ever   since   I   was   first   in   Scotland ,   so   I   was   there   received with   cordial   Friendship .   I   must   do   the   justice   to   the   Scottish nation   to   say ,   they   are   the   most   politely   hospitable   of   any people   in   the   World .   I   had   innumerable   invitations   of   which   I could   not   avail   myself ,   having   made   as   long   a   holyday   from   my business   in   Northumberland   as   I   could   afford .   I   am   very   glad to   find   by   letters   received   from   my   Brother   Robinson ,   that   he thinks   himself   better   for   ye   waters   of   aix .   The   news   papers will   inform   you   of   the   death   of   Mr   George   Granville .   I   think he   is   a   great   loss   to   the   publick ,   &   tho   in   these   days   of ribbaldery   &   abuse   he   was   often   much   calumniated ,   I   believe time   will   vindicate   his   character   as   a   publick   man as   a   private   one   he   was   quite   unblemish'd .   I   regret   the loss   to   myself .   I   was   always   pleased   &   informd   by   his conversation .   He   had   read   a   vast   deal &   had   an   amazing   memory ,   he   had   been   versed   in   business   from his   youth ,   so   that   he   had   a   very   rich   fund   of   conversation ,   & he   was   good   natured   &   very   friendly .   The   Kings   speech   has   a warlike   tone ,   but   still   we   flatter   ourselves   that   the   french Kings   aversion   to   War   may   prevent   our   being   again   engaged   in one .   It   is   reported   that   Mr   de   Grey   is   to   be   Ld   Keeper . Lord   Chatham   was   to   have   spoken   on   the   H:   of   Lords   to   day   if poor   Mr   Grenvilles   death   which   happened   at     this morning   had   not   hinderd   his   appearing   in   publick .   I   do   not find   that   any   change   of   Ministry   is   expected . My   Father   &   Brothers   are   very   well ,   my   Sister   has   got   the headach   today .   She   was   so   good   as   to   come   to   me   &   will   stay till   Mr   Montagu   arrives   in   Town .   He   did   not leave   Denton   till   almost   a   week   after   I   came   away ,   &   he   was stopd   at   Durham   by   waters being   out ;   but   I   had   the   pleasure   of   hearing   yesterday ,   that he   got   safe   to   Darlington ,   where   he   was   to   pass   a   few   days with   a   famous   Mathematician ,   but   I   expect   him   in   Town   the   end of   this   week .   My   Nephew   Morris   has   got   great   credit   at   Eton already .   My   Sister   has   in   general   her   health   extreamly   well ,   & I   have   got   much   better   than   I   was   in   the   Summer .   My   doctors order   me   to   forbear   writing ,   but   this   letter   does   not   shew   my obedience   to   them ,   I   wish   I   could   enliven   it   with   more   news . The   celebrated   Coterie   will   go   on   in   spite   of   all remostrances ,   &   there   is   to   be   an   assembly   thrice   a   week   for ye   subscribers   to   ye   Opera   into   ye   subscription ,   so   little impression   do   rumours   of   wars   &   apprehensions   of   the   plague make   on   a   fine   World .   I   beg   my   most   affectionate   compliments to   my   Brother .   I   am   in   yr debt   for   my   pretty   Neices   dancing   master ,   which   I   forgot   when I   had   ye   pleasure   of   seeing   you .   I   shall   hope   to   supply   her , as   opportunity   offers ,   with   all   the   assistance   of   that   sort which   her   happy   genius   will   make   of   great   use   to   her ,   but   your constant   care   will   supply   many   better   things   than   those   ye artists   teach ,   &   I   do   not   doubt   of   her   making   an   amiable   & valuable   Woman .   My   best   wishes   attend   her ,   her   pretty   Brother &   Sister .   Mrs   Scott   desires   her   best   compts .   With   the   most sincere   regard   I   am   dear   Madam your   very   affectionate   Sister and   faithfull   friend &   Hble   Servt E M I   know   you   will   be   glad   to   hear   I   left   every   thing   in   such order   in   ye   North   that   I   need   not   pay   my   devotions   to   ye   pole star   again   of   some   years 
BC_1771_EMONTAGU_BS	May   ye   Dear   Sir Mr   Baker   call d   on   me   last   night to   tell   me   he   had   not   accomodation   for   me   at   his   House , &   he   promised   to   engage   ye   House   which   was   Dr Morleys .   I   must   beg   of   you   to   put   him   in   mind of   his   promise ,   &   to   desire   him   to   be   careful   to   get the   House   aired .   I   know   he   will   have   a   due attention   to   your   commands .   I   dined   yesterday at   Hayes ,   &   the   weather   being   fine   had   the   pleasure of   seeing   the   place ,   which   is   so   alterd ,   &   so   astonishingly improved   since   I   lived   there ,   that   I   could almost   accuse   Ld   Chatham   of   Necromancy ;   he is   gran   mago   ,   &   has   call'd   forth   all   the   rural beauties   from   a   spot   which   was   once   very unpromising .   I   wish   you   could   see   how   sweet   a pastoral   scene   he   has   made   around   him .   I   was glad   to   see   his   Lordship   look   well   in   the   face ;   as   to   his stooping   &   walking   lame ,   I   think   it   gives   a   dignity to   the   Statesman ,   &   his   flannels   like   Ivy   round a   noble   Tower ,   make   the   Edifice   more   venerable . I   intend   to   send   a   couple   of   Maid   Servants   to   the Wells   on   Monday   to   air   the   beds   yt least   any   thing shd   be   neglected   of   that   importance ,   &   hope   Mr Baker   will   order   in   some   coals .   I   rejoyce   that Mrs   Pitt   &   you   have   had   such   fine   weather .   I   had intend'd   to   be   at   Tunbridge   on   tuesday ,   but   shall   defer my   journey   till   thursday .   My   best   respects   attend Mr   &   Mrs   Pitt .   I   am   Dear   Sir Your   most   affectte &   most   obliged E M No   news   of   Mr   Stewart , so   even   the   Month   of May   brings   not   ye Zephirs . 
BC_1771_EMONTAGU_EV	May   ye   My   dear   Sylphs   letters   cannot be   answer'd   as   they   deserve   to   night ,   a   great cold   sits   heavy   on   my   eye   lids   but   I   will   still tell   you   that   my   heart   beats   with   joy   whenever I   see   the   Sylph   hieroglyphics   on   paper . I   shd   rather   hope   from   your   account   that   Mr Salkelds   claim   will   prove   invalid .   As   to   ye name   &   title   they   have   been   so   soild   &   tarnishd that   truly   they   are   hardly   fit   for   an   honest Mans   wearing .   It   is   a   great   &   real   honour to   Lord   Lyttelton   that   Mr   Perry   &   the   Prime Serjeant   are   his   Friends .   I   have   sent   you enclosed   a   copy   of   verses   made   by   Mr Garrick   ye   other   day .   Dr   Cadogan   &   he   had at   dinner   a   warm   dispute   about   the merits   of   Shakespear   to   which   ye   Doctor is   very   insensible .   You   must   not   say   you had   ye   verses   from   me   for   it   will   look like   vanity   in   me   to   communicate   them but   I   cannot   see   why   so   much   good   witt as   ye   verses   contain   shd   be   conceal'd on   account   of   one   peice   of   wrong   judgment . The   Burkes   &   Garricks   are   to   dine   with   me   on wensday .   Lady   Chatham   &   her   family on   thursday .   Mr   &   Mrs   Garrick   &   several others   of   yr   friends   were   here   last   night but   we   all   feel   we   are   imperfect   witht our   Sylph .   I   have   got   Lady   Buchans pretty   House   at   Tunbridge   &   shall   be there   in   about     days .   Write   to   me   &   enliven my   spirits .   The   place   is   empty   but   the waters   &   quiet   will   restore   my   health which   of   late   has   not   been   good .   Ld   Lyttelton is   now   confined   by   a   feverish   cold . Mrs   Carter   dined   with   me   to   day .   According to   yr   hint   she   will   examine   Mrs   Norman . How   sweet   are   your   attentions .   How   happy one   is   in   having   such   a   friend !   But   how unhappy ,   that   Alps   rise   between   &   whole   oceans   roll   . I   do   not   think   we   have   had   any   works   lately which   wd   much   entertain   you . I   beg   my   best   compts   to   Mr   Vesey   &   Mrs Handcock .   I   am   my   dear   Madam With   most   sincere &   tender   affection yours E M 
BC_1771_EMONTAGU_MA_1	Friday   ye     Jan   Dear   Madam I   wish   I   could   thank   you   for   your   letter   in   as   fair characters   as   my   Neice   returnd   hers   for   the   books .   I   have ostentatiously   shewd   her   letter   to   many   of   my   Friends .   My Sister   &   I   have   not   let   my   Brother   share   in   the   honour ,   for   we confess ,   no   Robinson   ever   wrote   so   well ,   so   that   she   inherits this   with   many   other   good   things ,   from   her   Mama .   If   she   can compose   a   Sermon   as   well   as   her   Father ,   &   writes   it   in   her   own hand ,   it   will   retrieve   the   honour   of   Manuscripts   Sermons which   of   late   years   have   sold   cheaper   than even   any   other   second   hand   goods . The   Gentleman   to   whom   my   letter   was   deliverd   at   Paris   in September ,   loiterd   somewhere   on   the   road   till   ye   latter   end   of october ,   but   on his   arrival   put   the   letters   into   ye   post ,   the   letters   to you   which   should   have   preceded   my   coming   follow'd me . The   Town   is   very   empty ,   &   I   know   not   how   we   who   are   here contrive   to   be   as   much   engaged   as   at   other   seasons .   The   Bath has   been   very   full   of   Persons   of   distinction . Lord   Villiers   ( the   Prince   of   Maccaronies )   gave   a   few   days   ago a   Play   in   a   Barn .   He   acted   Ld   Townly , Miss   Hodges   Lady   Townly .   I   suppose   the   merit   of   this entertainment   was ,   that   people   were   to   go   many   miles   in   frost &   snow   to   see   in   a   Barn ,   what   wd   have   been   every   way   better at   the   Theaters   in   Drury   Lane   or   Covent   Garden .   There   was   a ball   also   prepared   after   ye   play ,   but   the   Barn   had   much benumbed   the   vivacity   of   ye   company ,   &   the   Beaux   feet   were   so cold ,   &   the   noses   of   the   Belles   were   so   blue ,   many   retired   to a   warm   bed   at   the   Inn   at   Henley   instead   of   partaking   of   the Dance .   Mr   Le   Texier   acted   Rousseau's   Pigmalion and   Miss   Hodges   the   Statue .   Modern   Nymphs   are   so   warm   & yielding ,   that   less   art   than   than   that   of   Mr   le   Texier might   have   animated   the   Nymph .   I   hope   my   Neices   will   never stand   still   to   be   made   love   to   before   a   numerous   audience . Miss   Hodges   Father   is   lately   dead ,   her   Mother   is   dying .   How many   indecorums   the   girl   has   brought   together   into   one   petite piece ! I   dare   not   send   you   any   publick   news   as   my   Brothers   are engaged   to   the   Congress   &   American   independency . I   think   the   fine   World   goes   on   as   usual   at   this   time   of   the year .   Caractacus   has   succeeded   very   well   on   the   stage ,   tho   it is   more   calculated   for   the   Study   than   the   Theater . Our   french   Ambassador   pleases   all   people   of   sense   by   his conversation   &   manners ,   by   his   splendor   of   living ,   &   polite attentions   at   table ,   he   charms   ye   great   vulgar ,   so   that he   is   in   general   esteem ,   &   indeed   deserves   to   be   so .   He   dined with   me   ye   other   day ,   &   I   am   to   dine   with   him   on   Sunday . Madme   de   Noailles   cannot   come   to   us   till   she   is   brought   to bed .   She   is   extreamly   sensible   &   agreable . Ld   Granby   very   thoughtlessly   carried   his   Lady   to   Brussels on   a   jaunt   of   amusement   soon   after   she   was   brought   to   bed ,   & by   getting   cold   she   has   been   most   dangerously   ill .   She   is   much better ,   but   ye   Duchess   Dowager   is   so   uneasy   about   her ,   I   am afraid   we   shall   not   be   able   to   disswade   her   from   going   to Brussels ,   tho   this   weather   makes   Sea   Voyages ,   &   indeed   Land journeys ,   very   terrible . I   hope   if   my   Brother   Robinson   goes   to   Bath   he   will   let   us enjoy   his   company   in   Town   for   a   few   days .   My   Sister   has   taken a   pretty   House   near   Cavendish   Square .   All   our   family   is   in health .   My   Nephew   Montagu   is   to   go   to   Harrow   on   tuesday   I suppose   you   know   Miss   Arnold   is   at   Bath .   Dr   de   la   Cour   is   in great   request   at   Bath . I   desire   my   best   compts   to   your   Consort .   My   Brother   Charles told   me   ye   good   folks   in   Kent   were   angry   with   me   for   making   a Justice   of   Peace   of   Dr   Pennington ,   but   indeed   I   never   heard the   Doctor   had   an   ambition   to   be   of   ye   Worshipfull   Quorum   till my   Brother   mentioned   it .   As   it   is   not   Greek   &   Hebrew ,   but Lands   &   Tenements   &   such   solid   property ,   which   give   a   title   to be   a   Justice   of   Peace ,   I   shd   not   have   any   way   assisted   ye Doctors   project   if   I   had   had   it   in   my   power   I   am   so   far   from being   a   favorer   of   ye   Alliance   of   Church   &   State   I   think   ye farther   they     a   Sunder   ye   better .   A   two   edged sword   is   a   terrible   weapon .   My   best   wishes   attend   all   yr fireside ,   may   every   new   year   bring   new   felicities   to   you   & emprove   those   of   which   you   are   already   in   possession . I   am   Dear   Madam your   most   affectionte   Sister &   Sincere   friend E Montagu I   have   sent   you   an   epitaphe   on   ye   King   of   Prussia 
BC_1771_EMONTAGU_MA_2	Aug:   ye     /   Dear   Madam Your   letter   which   I   have   just   received   would   have   given   me a   great   deal   of   pleasure ,   if   it   had   not   a   little   alarm'd   me   on account   of   my   dear   Neices   health .   I   do   not   apprehend   the   case to   be   at   all   dangerous ,   but   a   feverish   disorder   diminishes   the strength   &   spirits ,   &   consequently ,   for   a   time ,   will   rob   you of   the   delight   her   health   &   vivacity   used   to   give   you .   I   shall be   impartial   to   hear   she   is   quite   recoverd .   I   was   very   sorry that   your   Races   happen'd   so   untowardly   that   I   could   not   edge in   my   visit   without   being   implicated   in   them .   I   remember   the time ,   when   the   said   Races   would   have   a very   different   effect   than   deterring   me   from   the Neighbourhood ,   but   we   change   to   every   thing ,   &   every   thing changes   to   us .   I   cannot   say ,   that   as   one   grows   older   one   grows so   much   wiser   as   to   despise   foolish   amusements   but   one   likes new   kind   of   follies .   I   mean   we   always   like   some   of   those things   severe   &   frowning   wisdom   calls   follies .   I   had   the pleasure   of   finding   Mr   Montagu   in   extream   good   health ,   which gave   me   the   higher   satisfaction ,   as   I   had   been   alarmed   about him   some   time   before .   I   went   a   few   miles   out   of   my   road   to Sandleford   to   fulfil   my   old   promise   to   Mr Burke   at   Beconsfield   I   was   sorry   that   I   could   not   continue there   longer   than   one   whole   day ,   as   I   was   then   not   so   assured that   Mr   Montagu   was   in   perfect   health .   When   the   talents   of   a man   of   genius ,   the   acuteness of   a   Politician ,   the   alert   vivacity   of   the   man   of   business   are all   employd   to   make   conversation   agreable ,   &   society   pleasant , one   passes   ones   time   very   delightfully   in   such   company .   At Beconsfield   Mr   Burke   is   an   industrious   Farmer ,   a   polite Husband   a   kind   Master ,   a   charitable   Neighbour ,   &   a   most excellent   companion .   The   Demons   of   Ambition   &   Party   who   hover about   Westminster ,   do   not   extend   their   influence   so   far   as   the Villa .   I   know   not   why   it   is ,   but   there   busy spirits   seem   more   tranquil   &   placid   in   their   days   of   retreat than   the   honest   dull   justice   of   the   quorum ,   who   never snatchd   forth   his   hand   to   snatch   the   Scepter   of Power ,   or   raised   his   Voice   in   publick   to   fill   the   trumpet   of fame .   A   little   mind   is   far   even   in   a   tracessarie   because   it is   moved   by   little   things .   I   have   always   found   that   nothing   is so   gentle   as   the   chief   out   of   War , nor   so   serene   &   simple   as   the   Statesman   out   of   place .   If   it were   fit   to   name   names ,   &   certify   places ,   I   could   bring many   examples   to   justify   my   assertion .   I   so   much   delight   in these   Working   Master   spirits   in   their   holyday   humour ,   that   I had   rather   play   at   Fee   Fofum   or   cross   &   pile   with Julius   Caesar   than   with   Sardanapalus ,   the   first   wd   have   ye easy   &   difference   which   belongs   to   play ,   the   other   ye seriousness   &   anxiety   which   belongs   to business .   I   am   now   preparing   for   a   little   excursion   in   which   I shall   see   some   of   the   busy   folks   of   the   great   World ,   so   I expect   to   pass   my   time   in   the   more   joyous tranquillity .   On   friday   I   am   to   go   to   Stowe .   Lord   &   Lady Temple   having   given   me   repeated   invitations   there .   I   am   much afraid   the   weather   will   not   favour   my   excursion ,   however   as   I shall   stay   four   days   at   Stowe ,   I   hope   to   see   those   suberbe gardens   while   I   am   there   in   favourable   gleams   of   sunshine .   I have   not   seen   Stowe since   I   first   married .   Lord   Temple   I   hear   has   much   improved them .   I   shall   have   the   pleasure   of   making   a   visit   at   another fine   place   which   I   never   yet   saw ,   which   is   Lord   Nunehams   in Oxfordshire . I   have   not   seen   Mr   &   Mrs   Griffith   since   I   came   to Sandleford ,   but   hear   they   are   well .   Mr   Herbert   has   given   us a   very   agreable   Neighbour   in   Lady   Elizabeth .   She   has   been   very well   educated ,   &   I   dare   say   will   always   behave   with   great propriety .   Mr   Herbert   is   a   young   man   of   uncommon understanding   &   merit .   He   is   come   early ,   &   not   too   early ,   into ye   possession   of   an   ample   fortune . I   am   sorry   my   Brother   is   not   quite   so   well   as   he   was   at Aix .   My   health   is   perfectly   good   I   am   much   pleased   to   hear   my Neice   is   so   tractable   &   good ,   a   disposition   to   oblige   her Parents   &   to   do   what   those   who   love   her   advise   her   to   will make   her   much   happier than   wilfulness   &   obstinacy .   As   to   my   Nephew   he   is   too   young to   listen   to   reason   if   medicine   be   necessary   I   should   think   it might   be   conveyd   down   his   throat   by   holding   his   nose   &   laying him   flat   on   his   back .   I   find   he   is   much   afraid   of   uttering idle   words ,   the   same   apprehension   wd   be   unnatural   &   a   girl ,   so   I   rejoyce   that   Miss   Mary   prates   away .   My   Nephew Morris   &   Matt   are   just   arrived   they   are   fine   boys   Morris   grows very   handsome ,   &   he   has   a   very   good   character   amongst   his school   fellows .   These   little   Men   will   be   a   great   amusement   to Mr   Montagu   in   my   absence .   I   pass'd   my   time   very   well   at Tunbridge   having   so   agreable   a   companion   at   home   as   my   Sister , so   I   depended   on   the   great   World   for   nothing   more   than   vagrant amusement   at   idle   hours ;   &   this   is   all   one   can   reasonably expect   of   the   great   World ,   one   shd   have   ones   solid   comforts at   home .   One   makes   a   good   meal ,   the   other   a   pleasant   dessart . Having   a   letter   of   business   to   send   to   the   Recorder   I   beg   of you   to   do   it   at   some   convenient   opportunity ,   for   it   wd   be unconscionable   to   cost   him   postage   for   my   business ,   &   I   have not   yet   a   frank   for   him   Mr   Montagu   desires   his   compts   to you   &   My   Brother ,   to   whom   I   beg   mine ,   with   love   &   good   wishes to   the   little   ones   particularly   the   dear   little   Invalide .   I regret   that   poor   Mr   Gray   is   now   no   more   than   Pindar ,   one fatal   moment   sets   two   or   three   thousand   years aside   &   brings   the   account   equal .   I   realy   believe   our   Brittish Pindar   not   unequal   in   merit   to   the   Bard   of Thebes .   I   hope   Mr   Gray   has   left   some   works   yet   unpublish'd . I   am   Dear   Madam Your   most   affectte   Sister And   very   sincere   friend &   Hble   Servt Eliz:   Montagu

BC_1775_EMONTAGU_EC_1	July     My   Dearest   friend Perhaps   about   the   very   hour   I   had the   pleasure   of   your   letter   you   would   receive   my   long   journal of   my   travels ,   it   would   not   be   full   of   such   strange matter   as   Mr   Bruce   entertains   the   reader ,   but   I   believe they   wd   be   interesting   to   you   for   the   sake   of   the   writer . &   you   wd   not   regret   that   I   had   not   eaten   beef   stakes   while the   Ox   was   bellowing   beside   the   Gridiron .   I   have   this very   morning   been   portioning   out   one   of   these   animals to   send   to   the   Houses   of   my   Pittmen ,   but   we   kill d   ye Creature   before   we   began   to   joint   him .   I   am   sincerely mortified   at   what   you   tell   me   of   Mrs   W:   Robinsons speaking   of   a   favour   you   did   to   me ;   I   never   mention d   it to   any   one   breathing ,   but   knew guess   how   she   came   by her   information .   My   brother   Morris   does   all   law   matters for   me ;   I   thought   if   I   employ d   another   Lawyer   to   do   your annuity   ( &   another   of   greater   value )   it   would   look if   any   accident   discoverd   it   during   my   life ,   or   in   case of   my   death   when   it   must   appear   to   him ,   as   if   I imagined   my   family   might   dislike   my   using   my own   in   my   own   manner ,   or   that   I   stood   in   awe   of my   kindred ,   neither   of   these   did   I   think   suitable   to my   friends   dignity   or   my   own .   I   am   so   little   versed in   Law   proceedings   I   could   not   draw   ye   Bonds   myself therefore   I   desired   my   Brother   to   bring   them   in due   form .   He   seem d   much   pleased   with   the intention   &   with   less   delay   than   Lawyers   are usually   apt   to   put   into   their   proceedings   he brought   them .   I   was   desirous   they   shd   be   legally secure ,   because ,   it   sometimes   happens ,   that people   lose   their   senses   by   paralytick   seizures , &   such   a   misfortune   might   befall   me ,   &   there might   be   a   long   interval   between   that   & my   death ,   during   which   period   my   Friends would   have   lost   ye   little   token   I   had   given them   of   my   affection .   I   desired   my   Brother   not to   mention   these   matters ,   whether   Midas   told   his Queen   &   she   whisperd   it   to   ye   Rushes   I   cannot say .   You   told   ye   Sylph ,   &   she   tells   all   she   knows to   Miss   Cooper .   I   charged   ye   Sylph   not   to   mention   it . I   love   to   tell   any   thing   that   is   worth   telling , but   really   there   is   not   any   thing   in   this   to   tell   .   I   had   a melon   sent   me   ye   other   day ,   &   it   was   large &   ripe ,   which   considering   our   Northern   latitude would   be   better   worth   mentioning ,   for   I   flatter myself   my   little   territories   will   afford   more little   tokens   to   my   friends ,   than   ye   Gentlemans Gardens   will   melons   yet   I   protest   I   have   never   spoken   of it ,   &   I   have   eaten   it   too ,   &   you   have   not   tasted of   my   golden   pepper ,   for   tho   there   was   a quarter   due   at   Midsummer ,   I   thought   it   so shabby   a   sum   I   durst   not   mention   it ,   but delay d   till   michaelmass ,   when   half   a   year will   be   due ,   &   I   shall   leave   a   standing order   with   Mr   Hoare   to   pay   it   half   yearly to   your   Banker .   You   hurt   me   exceedingly   when you   say   your   silence   on   this   subject   wd   have an   air   of   ingratitude ,   neither   ingratitude   nor gratitude   can   have   any   place   here   at   all ,   there is   nothing   in   the   subject   to   which   either   of these   can   adhere .   The   obligation   is   certainly   on my   side ,   you   let   me   buy   more   pleasure   with ye   money   than   it   could   possibly   purchase me   any   other   way .   My   domestick   expenses will   be   so   much   below   my   Income ,   that   I   am as   much   obliged   to   those   I   love   if   they   will accept   some   of   it   as   I   should   be   to   any   one who   wd   turn   a   stream   of   waste   water   out of   my   grounds   into   a   little   brook   that   wd beautify   my   prospect .   I   reckon   my   love   &   affection is   worth   at   least   ten   thousand   pd   a   year to   you ,   your   love   &   affection   is   certainly   not worth   less   to   me ,   we   must   never   therefore bring   paltry   sums   into   ye   account .   I   was   really ready   to   shed   tears   of   vexation   at   your   using ye   phrase   of   gratitude   to   me .   I   have   not   been   so   hurt a   long   time ,   but   you   did   not   mean   to   hurt   me so   I   am   not   angry ,   or   at   least   not   very   angry I   am   sure   you   will   never   do   so   any   more ,   if   the   nasty word   shd   ever   rise   in   yr   throat   pray   spit   it   into   ye fire . I   have   had   a   charming   letter   from   my charming   Godson   but   he   directed   to   Tunbridge   so it   came   to   hand   only   yesterday . You   are   delightfull   with   yr   Lady   C:   M ,   as   if   a poor   Coal   owner   knew   any   thing   of   ye   quality , pray   explain   to   yr   country   correspondent . Nothing   can   be   more   just   than   what   you   say   of the   Regatta ,   pomp   makes   littleness   seem   more   contemptible as   long   robes   make   a   dwarf   appear   more   dwarfish . I   find   all   here   as   prosperous   as   my   heart   could wish ,   more   than   it   durst   wish ,   so   far   does   my prosperity   exceed   my   deserts .   Miss   Gordon   &   Miss   Annie Gregory   came   to   us   yesterday   &   I   expect   Dr   &   Mrs   Beattie very   soon . I   am   my   dearest   friend Ever   most   affectly Yours Eliz:   Montagu 
BC_1775_EMONTAGU_EC_2	My   Dearest   Friend I   have   still   waited   in   hopes   of   laying hold   of   a   member   of   Parlmt   hand   to   give   me   franks for   you   but   have   not   had   a   proper   opportunity   & at   present   have   little   opportunity   being   prisoner at   discretion   to   Dr   Forthergill   on   account   of   a   severe visit   of   ye   disorder   in   my   stomach   &   bowels   yesterday . I   am   much   better   to   day ,   &   indeed   ye   complaint which   has   been   very   general ,   has   been   less   harsh with   me   than   with   most   people .   I   am   much better   to   day   &   hope   by   to   morrow   to   be   quite   so   but must   for   some   time   keep   myself   warm   &   quiet . Our   Sylph   calld   on   me   last   night   her   stomach has   been   more   than   usually   out   of   order   but   she does   not   abate   a   dish   at   dinner   or   a   visit   in a   day   on   that   account .   She   is   the   reverse   of   ye   generality of   ye   idle   World   whose   felicity   or   infelicity   depends   on the   present   hour ,   hers   is   made   of   future   prospects . She   was   very   impatient   for   my   coming   to London   &   is   very   uneasy   at   an   apprehension of   my   going   but   in   the   intermediate   time ,   tho   she has   known   that   I   have   not   been   out   for   a   week together   sometimes ,   she   has   call d   but   rarely   &   then in   great   haste   to   go   to   two   or   three   other   places . Her   enjoyments   &   pains   are   all   in   some   space   or time   in   which   she   does   not   personally   &   actually   exist . My   health   not   having   been   very   good   I   have   as   yet declined   making   evening   parties   at   home   &   White &   my   Butler   being   absent   it   was   not   convenient . Thus   much   of   my   letter   was   written   a   week   ago   but my   complaint   having   rather   encreased   for   some days   I   thought   it   better   you   shd   attribute   yr   not receiving   a   letter   from   me   to   ye   fault   of   ye   Post than   my   infirmities   I   wd   not   write   till   I   cd   give a   perfect   good   account   of   myself   which   I   thank   God I   can   now   do .   I   have   not   had   ye   least   fever   nor   any alarming   symptom   but   ye   fashionable   disorder   in ye   bowels   having   stopp d   too   suddenly   Dr   Fothergill thought   it   safest   in   order   to   prevent   disagreable consequences   to   ply   me   with   purging   doses ,   they pass d   through   me   but   without   so   much   effect   as was   desired   this   morning   I   had   a   gentle   dose   with Calomel   which   has   achd   properly .   My   spirits   have not   flagged ,   my   strength   is   not   impaired   &   now ye   disorder   is   carried   off   I   may   hope   in   a   few days   to   be   rather   better   for   what   has   happend . So   my   dear   Friend   be   quite   easy ,   by   ye   Drs   permission I   eat   a   good   dinner   of   pheasant   &   boild   whiting . I   thought   it   wd   make   you   uneasy   if   I   wrote   account   or   let   Secretary   Gregory   write   it   & I   wd   not   deceive   you   as   then   you   wd   never   have believed   me   again .   Dr   Fothergill   says   all   is   over   & that   there   never   was   ye   least   danger .   My   complaint he   says   was   not   an   obstraction   but   an   obstacle , a   nice   distinction   tho   not   on   a   nice   subject .   The purging   had   left   relicks   which   he   judged   necessary to   I/carry/   off   in   ordinary   to   which   he   went   cautiously on   to   teize   my   guts   to   fiddlestrings ,   but   I   am   much obliged   to   him   for   his   tender   &   infinite   attention . Vesey   has   paid   kind   attentions   to   ye   Invalid .   My   Sister and   my   Gregory   have   been   most   kind   nurses . I   am   in   sickness   or   health   &   in   ye   present   joy   of recovery   most   sincerely   affectly   &   entirely yrs   E M Saturday   night . 
BC_1775_EMONTAGU_EV_1	Hillstreet   /   Oct   ye   I   hope   this   will   find   my   dear   Sylph enjoying   all   the   tranquill   delights   of   an   autumnal noon   in   the   groves   of   Kingston .   There   is   a   sweet   melancholly in   this   Season ,   the   zephirs   seem   to   whisper   their   adieux to   Flora ,   the   animal   world   is   less   gay   than   in   Summer , the   Heavens   are   vested   in   deep   colour d   clouds ,   the Woods   &   Groves   boast   no   longer   the   chearfull     ,   the prelude   to   Winter   is   serious   &   solemn .   My   mind   often visits   you   in   yr   walks ,   &   I   will   confess   to   you ,   it   is at   present   in   the   very   tune   which   suits   the   autumnal season .   I   find   something   painfull   in   the   thought of   leaving   my   Friends   for   six   or   seven   months the   more   because   it   is   at   ye   very   time   of   year when   I   used   to   be   preparing   to   meet   them .   you my   dear   Sylph   have   a   great   share   of   my   regret   on this   occasion ,   but   the   great   amendment   of   health   which I   really   hope   from   a   Winter   in   a   better   climate   may enable   me   to   enjoy   more   of   your   company ,   &   perhaps for   a   longer   term   of   years .   I   wrote   to   you   that   I   was disappointed   of   ye   House   at   Montauban ,   so   I   shall not   decide   about   my   place   of   residence   till   I   get to   Paris .   My   Carriages   will   be   all   ready   by   tomorrow night ,   but   I   cannot   conveniently   set   out   before Saturday ,   &   if   ye   weather   is   bad   I   will   not   even leave   Hillstreet   till   it   mends .   A   thousand   thanks for   yr   billet   to   night .   I   have   been   very   busy   all day ,   &   am   much   fatigued   otherwise   I   wd   have written   you   a   longer   letter .   The   letter   to   you   which   was returnd   hither   by   Mr   Sprange   I   threw   into   ye   fire .

BC_1775_EMONTAGU_EV_2	Hillstreet ye   My   dear   Sylph Millions   of   thanks   for   ye   kind   note yesterday ,   &   for   your   kinder   because   longer epistolary   favour   of   to   day .   I   am   better   in health   &   spirits   since   I   was   blooded ,   but   still ye   bustle   of   ye   ensuing   journey   is   like   a Whirlwind   about   me .   I   am   sensibly   obliged to   you   for   all   you   say   to   cheer   my   spirits on   quitting   my   native   Land ,   you   owed me   indeed   the   consolatory   words ,   for   you are   one   of   my   chief   &   greatest   regrets   in leaving   it .   I   could   have   left   Great   Brittain with   all   its   Inhabitants   with   much   less pain   if   a   sweet   little   Woman   born   in Ireland   had   not   been   in   the   way .   I   told   you in   my   last   that   all   people   advise   me rather   to   Nice   than   to   any   other   part of   France   unless   I   wd   stay   in   the   good Citty   of   Paris .   What   is   a   Citty   without a   Vesey   &   there   will   not   be   a   Vesey   there so   I   will   not   stay   in   it .   I   really   hope great   benefit   to   my   health .   I   design   at my   return   to   give   you   my   picture . As   you   are   so   unduly   out   to   ye   pictures of   my   mind   I   propose   to   order   some copies   of   my   old   letters   to   various   correspondents to   be   deliverd   to   you   as   soon   as   they can   be   written   out .   When   you   have   read them   you   shall   deliver   them   to   my Sister .   You   must   not   let   any   one   see   them but   Mr   Vesey   &   Mrs   Hancock .   Mr   Burke Sr   G:   Macartney   &   Mr   C:   Fox   calld   in ye   other   day   while   Sr   Josh   was   doing my   picture ,   we   talkd   of   you   &   I   believe my   portrait   will   wear   a   softer   smile for   it .   Mr   Burke   kindly   call d   on   me the   next   day .   I   have   not   a   moment I   can   call   my   own   you   will   therefore excuse   my   not   thanking   you   as   I shd   do   for   ye   sweet   charming   letter . I   propose   to   set   out   on   tuesday   for Canterbury   for   France   perhaps   on Wensday .   I   may   steal   a   moment   at Dover   to   write   to   you .   Compts   to   all   at   Kingston Ever   most   affectly E M I   dont   credit   ye   rumour of   ye   diverse   promotions to   be   at   present .   I   have   enclosed   you   a   letter to   Ld   Bath   which   you   will return   to   my   Sister   with ye   others .   The   letter   is   not worth   ye   reading   to   one who   does   not   love   ye writer   as   partially   as   you   do 
BC_1775_EMONTAGU_EV_3	Canterbury   Friday   ye   My   Dear   Friend   perhaps   thinks   I   am now   tossing   on   ye   Occasion Ocean   .   alas   no   such   thing ,   I   am at   my   Brothers   at   Canterbury ,   confined   to   a great   chair   with   a   little   nasty   slow   fever ,   I   caught cold   in   ye   journey ,   sneez d   much ,   had   a   soreness   in my   throat ,   but   was   no   otherwise   ill   the   night I   arrived ,   &   went   to   bed   in   good   spirits .   Post   horses orderd   for   my   Carriages   &   Servant   to   carry   me to   Dover   ye   next   morning ,   in   ye   night   I   had a   pain   in   my   stomach   &   was   feverish .   The   next   day I   got   Dr   Douglass   ( Mrs   Carters   Brother ) .   I   think   I   am better   for   his   draughts .   I   have   before   had   such   fevers they   are   tedious   but   without   ye   least   danger   so   be they   my   sweet   Sylph .   I   wd   not   let   Gregory   write   least you   shd   be   alarmd .   My   soreness   of   throat   is   much   better I   have   a   comfortable   habitation ,   &   my   Brother   is   vastly   kind &   attentive ,   his   House   is   well   conducted   &   all   things   in great   order   &   his   Servants   prodigiously   clever   &   civil .   He remembers   your   politeness   to   him   at   Tunbridge   &   begs his   compts .   My     Brother   lives   near   Canterbury   he   & his   Wife   are   to   dine   here   today .   There   has   been   a   violent storm   these     hours   I   hope   you   did   not   think   I   was on   ye   Ocean   it   wd   have   been   worse   than   my   languid state   in   my   easy   chair . Most   affectly   yrs E M I   wd   not   let   Greg write   for   me   least you   shd   be   alarmd   about my   fever . 
BC_1775_EMONTAGU_MO	Wensday   ye   Dear   Brother I   received   your   letter   &   the   subpena yesterday   in   the   afternoon ,   &   I   sent   immediately for   an   attorney   from   Newcastle ,   but   he   was   not to   be   got ,   however   I   will   take   care   to   get   the affair   done   if   possible   to   day .   It   was   fortunate I   sent   for   my   letters   yesterday ,   they   are   generally convey d   hither   the   day   after   they   come   to Newcastle   by   the   Hexham   post ,   &   in   that   case I   shd   not   have   had   yr   letter   time   enough ,   as you   say   wensday   is   ye   latest   day .   The   letters are   coming     days   from   London   to   Newcastle .   I   wrote   as you   suggested   to   Mr   Archdeacon ,   but   whether he   will   be   sober   enough   to   understand   my   letter I   know   not .   He   is   fallen   into   a   sad   course   of   life . His   eldest   Daughter   call d   on   me   when   I   stopped to   change   horses   at   Durham   their   Grandfather has   left   L   amongst   eight   Children   of   Mr Archdeacons ,   &   I   fear   it   is   all   they   will   get   for his   child a   girl   has   got   ye   entire   management of   him ,   &   they   say   she   takes   his   money   when he   is   drunk   out   his   bureau   but   I   believe   he squanders   it   himself   We   have   high   winds   &   little   rain , &   beef   has   been   d   a   pound   in   Newcastle market .   I   had   a   visit   yesterday   from   Mr   &   Mrs Bigge ,   they   enquired   kindly   after   my   Nephew Morris ,   &   said   very   handsome   things   of   him . I   am   very   sorry   you   had   any   disappointment about   little   Matt ,   &   the   more   as   I   was   the innocent   cause   of   it .   When   I   applied   to   Mr Burrows   to   take   the   dear   boy ,   he   said   he feard   he   might   not   be   able   to   be   of   service to   him ,   for   as   he   was   a   favourite ,   he   wd   perhaps be   often   sent   away ,   &   such   interruptions unsettled   young   minds ,   I   promised   I   wd   not send   for   him ,   &   indeed   I   understood   you   ( or rather   I   find   misunderstood   you )   that you   would   not   do   it .   He   has   been   but   a month   at   Hadley ,   if   he   is   to   be   interrupted every   month   I   fear   he   will   make   little progress ,   but   certainly   I   did   not ,   nor   do   not mean ,   to   assume   any   sort   of   authority ,   nor in   the   least   to   hinder   whatever   you   shall judge   proper .   I   will   always   provide   him with   the   best   means   of   improvement ,   & there   my   power   begins   &   ends .   As   it   is   matter of   favour   &   friendship   to   me   that   Mr   Burrows undertakes   ye   care   of   the   little   Man ,   I   shd be   much   obliged   to   you ,   if   you   wd   acquaint him   before   hand ,   when   you   intend   to   send   for him .   I   must   take   blame   to   my   self   for   having rashly   assured   Mr   Burrows   he   wd   not   be taken   from   his   studies ,   but   what   you   said , &   your   leaving   my   Nephew   Morris   with Mr   Powis   &   at   Eaton ,   except   at   holydays , drew   me   into   ye   mistake ,   &   indeed   I   was so   perswaded   of   it   that   I   was   under   great   concern for   the   Childs   health   when   Mrs   Fry   mentiond his   coming   home ,   till   I   had   ( just   before   I   received yours )   a   letter   from   Matt ,   saying   he   was to   go   home   to   see Chancery   Lane   or   his   new   apartment   at LdCamdens ,   &   he   chose   ye   latter ,   which   I   thought very   prudent   especialy   as   he   had   lately   been   at   home some   months ,   &   only   a   short   time   at   Hadley . My   Father   is   very   obliging   in   what   he   says of   the   little   token   I   have   given   by   my   love   to a   Sister   who   deserves   every   kindness   from   me , I   know   she   has   a   great   deal   of   delicacy ,   &   any considerable   sum   might   have   distressed her ,   it   is   always   pleasant   to   receive   a little   marks of   a   friends   love ,   but   when   they   are   encreased to   obligations   they   are   heavy ,   I   wd   put   a   gold ring   on   ye   finger   of   a   friend   but   not   a   fetters   which they   wd   be   to   a   mind   so   generous   as   Mrs   Scotts   to the   ungenerous   they   are   only   a   cudgell   with which   they   bruise   the   benefactor   to   shew   a mind   superior   to   obligations ,   &   from   some   study of   human   nature ,   in   which   I   read   my   own   imperfections &   those   of   others ,   I   shall   never   confer   any favour   which   can   create   a   new   set   of   duties   to be   expected   by   me   or   paid   by   another ,   for   from   such arise   uneasy   jealousies   on   all   sides .   I   propose   that ye   course   of   my   expenses   shd   keep   so   far   behind my   income   that   my   friends   need   no   more   scruple to   take   ye   overflowings   of   my   purse   than   any waste   water ,   for   if   they   do   not   accept   of   it ,   it   shall flow   into   ye   Great   Ocean   of   Human   Society .   I   design to   make   an   experiment   whether   a   rich   Person cannot   avoid   being   a   Prodigal   or   Miser .   All   I   ever propose   to   derive   from   my   liberality   is   the   satisfaction of   my   own   mind ,   &   the   general   respect   a   character of   liberality   will   acquire ,   two   things   perfectly independent   of   any   individual ,   but   must   arise   from   ye   nature of   things ,   &   of   which   neither   envy   nor   malice can   deprive   me ,   &   it   will   never   be   in   any   ones   power to   be   ungratefull   to   me   because   I   shall   never make   anothers   gratitude   my   object .   I   have seen   people   suffer   much   from   a   selfish   solicitude on   this   head ,   &   they   lead   as   weary   &   uneasy a   life   as   a   miser   wd   who   in   hopes   of   some     advantage   had to   lend   his   money   to   Bankrupts ,   &   indeed I   think   they   deserve   it ,   for   they   do   not   give from   any   kind   or   generous   principle ,   or   at least   it   has   too   much   of   ye   levain   of   self   love in   it .   My   age   forbids   me   to   hope   any   long   enjoyment of   my   possessions ,   but   by   enlarging   the   circle of   benevolence   &   encreasing   friendly   connections I   may   hope   for   a   chearfull   old   age ,   wide shd   be   the   circle   of   the   Xmass   fireside   of human   life .   I   wont   like   many   good   old   folks creep   into   ye   jaundice   by   being   peevish ,   & harrass   two   or   three   miserable   expectants   with ill   humour ,   as   Heirless   Misers   are   wont   to   do , saying   in   their   hard   hearts ,   these   people   will be   paid   for   this   by   &   by .   Alas !   What   can   pay for   insults   indured   &   ye   arrows   of   peevishness , &   storms   of   anger .   I   rejoyce   much   that   my situation   is   indeed   most   perfectly   independent . Owing   every   thing   entirely   to   the   blessing   of God   &   Mr   Montagu ,   I   am   in   no   danger   of being   controuled   or   teized ,   so   that   I   may   be as   easy   from   others   humours   as   they   from mine ,   which   is   a   great   felicity ,   for   the   unhappiness of   human   life   arises   not   so   much   from distempers   or   poverty   as   the   plague   we   are apt   to   be   of   to   each   other   in   near   connections from   the   fermentation   of   humours   in   ye human   mind   for   the   rest   of   my   life ,   all the   bustle   these   things   make ,   will   but Roll   o'er   my   Grotto   &   but   sooth   my   sleep   ,   perhaps I   may   sometimes   laugh   in   my   sleep ,   for   I   find I   grow   more   good   humoured   every   day   being in   my   unyoked   condition   ungalled   in   any   way . I   expect   Miss   Gordon   &   Miss   Annie   Greg   here   to   morrow   or   friday .   I   was   desirous   to   Miss   Gordon   all   possible   civility   in   return to   her   great   kindness   to   my   Nephew   Morris , &   yr   expence   of   their   journey   will   be   no   greater than   of   Miss   Gregorys   going   to   them ,   &   she must   take   leave   of   them   before   we   go   abroad . Pray   makes   my   best   compts   to   Mrs   Robinson   & give   my   love   to   my   Nephew . I   am   Dr   Brother Your   most   affect   Sister &   sincere   friend Eliz   Montagu I   have   rectified   my   mistake with   Mr   Burrows   so   ye   young Gentleman   will   always   be ready   as   often   as   you   please   to   send way   even   over . P S. I   sent   Ed:   Brown   &   John   Osgood   to   take   directions of   yr   Attorney   how   to   deliver   &   witness   ye   Subpena but   Mr   Archdeacon   has   kept   his   bed   these     days &   I   believe   is   very   drunk .   John   is   come   back   but   Brown is   still   at   ye   House   Whether   ye   affair   will   be   effected if   it   had   come   two   days   sooner   ye   business   might   have been   done ,   he   took   to   his   bed   yesterday ,   &   ye   Servants   refused my   people   admittance .   Since   I   wrote   ye     the   subpoena   has been   deliverd   &   I   receiv d   ye   enclosed   card .   The   gentleman   was   tolerably tipsey   but   had   ye   caution   to   consult   Mr   Faxcalle   before   he   wd receive   ye   subpena . 
BC_1775_EMONTAGU_SS	Wensday   night My   dear   Sister I   had   written   a   note   yester to   day to   accompany   yr   cream ,   brown   bread ,   &   pork , but   they   slipt   away   with : t   my   note ,   so as   I   can   give   a   good   account   of   myself   I   will send   it   tomorrow   morn :   by   penny   post . I   had   a   good   night   last   night ,   &   am   better to   day   than   I   have   been   since   my   illness . The   night   before   last   I   was   very   ill ,   so   Dr   Fothergill changed   my   medicines   &   gave   me   some draughts   which   have   done   me   great   service . I   hope   time   &   care   will   set   me   up   again , but   it   will   be   difficult   to   keep   myself long   in   this   quiet   state ,   &   when   once   my doors   are   open   ye   tyde   is   apt   to   set   in very   strong .   Mrs   Cholmly   has   had   a   touch of   ye   Influenza   which   has   threwn   her back   again .   Dreadfull   stories   are   told   of   ye mortality   of   this   disorder ,   but   Dr   Fothergill says   that   he   has   seen   few   very   dangerously ill ,   who   have   not   exposed   themselves   to ye   cold   air .   Mr   Farquahar   for   want   of timely   care   keeps   his   bed   &   is   very   bad .   My family   is   getting   better   except   Mary   White who   began   to   be   ill   only   to   day ,   she   is   very robust   &   I   believe   will   not   be   long   indisposed , &   she   is   not   so   ill   as   to   interrupt   her   attendance on   me .   Betty   Tull   who   arrived   to   night   gives me   great   pleasure   by   telling   how   usefull my   pottatoes   are   to   ye   Poor ,   you   must know   that   to   ye   poor   they   are   sold by   gallon   or   peck   cheaper   than   per Bushel   to   ye   Shops   so   that   ye   poor come     or     miles   to   buy   them .   Woodhouse writes   me   word   he   has   taken   between   &     L   in   this   retail   wpay   &   I   hope   that   has made   as   much   stomach   stuffing   for poor   Children   as     times   ye   money   in   bread . the   poor   much   rejoyce   in   my   pottatoe shop .   What   a   poor   story   is   human   life   when one   of   ye   best   chapters   in   a   good   Womans   history is   retailing   pottatoes ?   Love   to   Miss   A: Ever   most   affectly Yrs E M I   am   afraid   yr influenza   was ye   worse   for   yr coming   abroad 
BC_1776_EMONTAGU_EC	Sandleford April     My   dear   Friend I   suppose   you   fine   London   Ladies think   the   best   thing   that   can   be   said of   the   poor   Souls   in   the   Country ,   is ,   that they   enjoy   good   health .   I   cannot   but own   that   I   am   a   little   anxious   to   hear   that even   in   your   more   exalted   sphere   of life   you   possess'd possess   the   same   vulgar comfort ,   for   you   seem'd   not   well   the morning   I   parted   from   you .   We   had   fine weather   in   our   journey   with   its   usual alloy ,   glaring   Sunshine ,   &   much   dust . However   as   Sunshine   &   dust   are   not dangerous   to   health ,   I   did   not   murmur . I   was   a   good   deal   indisposed   on   wensday night ,   but   at   Sandleford   found   ye   rural blessings   health   &   quiet .   I   have   a   full quire   of   Nightingales ,   but   dare   not   follow their   invitation   to   the   night   Concerts in   the   ye   Wood .   I   catch   a   Song   at   my dressing   room   Window   as   it   floats   upon the   Wings   of   night ,   &   I   extinguish   my bougies   sometimes   to   receive   the   gentle light   of   Cynthia .   But   the   moonlight ramble   is   prohibited   to   weak   health . If   Jean   Jacques   was   peeping   over   my shoulder   he   would   say ,   I   had   debilitated my   natural   powers   by   civil   habits ,   & that   I   might   have   walk d   upon   all fours   with   impunity   at   any   hour ,   if I   had   been   brought   up   in   the   Woods instead   of   a   City .   True   indeed   my   Sylvan Philosopher !   but   it   was   through   the delicacy   of   a   Town   education   that   I   acquired a   taste   for   the   Song   of   ye   Nightingale , &   the   faint   beams   of   ye   Moon ,   &   thus end   most   speculations   with   infinite ingenuity   of   argument   but   a   impotence of   conclusion .   I   should   say   much   in   favour of   my   system ,   Jean   Jacques   wd   say   well in   favour   of   his ,   at   last   I   should   step into   my   Carriage ,   &   he   would   stalk away   on   all   fours ,   neither   of   us better   inform'd   or   reformed . I   have   orderd   White   to   call   on   you   to know   when   you   wd   appoint   Mr Dilly   to   wait   on   you   about   the corrections   of   my   poor   Works .   I   am ashamed   to   think   of   ye   trouble   I   gave you ,   but   realy   I   was   unable   to   write them   over ,   &   they   were   illegible   to any   one   but   a   Friend   used   to   my scrawl .   All   here   desire   their   compts . My   little   man   is   pure   well . I   am   my   dear   Friend Ever   yours   E M 
BC_1776_EMONTAGU_EV_1	Sandleford   ye     april My   dear   Sylph The   smiling   morn ,   the   breathing   Spring , Invite   the   tunefull   birds   to   sing and   your   idle   friend   to   saunter   in   the   Garden , but   I   will   first ,   according   to   your   kind   commands , inform   you   of   my   safe   arrival   here .   The   history of   a   good   journey ,   through   a   turnpike   road ,   wd   be as   dull   as   the   history   of   an   honest   discreet Man   in   common   life .   Were   even   the   celebrated Mr   Letexier   to   read   either   of   them   to   you   they   wd make   you   yawn .   It   is   the   marvellous   adventure , the   strange   rencontre   ,   the   odd   disaster ,   the unaccountable   deviation   out   of   the   right road ,   that   give   interest   to   the   tale .   as   neither Melpomene   nor   Thalia   will   give   a   smile , or   a   tear ,   on   my   story ,   I   will   only   say   I   got safe   to   the   end   of   my   journey ,   &   am   very happy   in   the   place   to   which   it   brought   me . I   feel   a   sympathetick   joy   by   seeing   every thing   around   me   in   its   gayest   season .   The youth   of   the   year ,   &   the   youthful   age   of my   Companions   inspire   heartfelt   delight . Tho   my   way   of   life   is   fallen   into   ye   Sere   &   yellow   leaf I   rejoyce   to   see   the   gay   blossoms   of   the   spring budding   in   them .   It   requires   all   my   discretion sometimes   not   to   be   childish   with   my   boy ,   & girlish   with   my   Missy .   But   it   seems   to   me so   essential   ,   to   wear   a   certain   sedateness ,   & assumed   gravity ,   where   it   is   necessary   to have   authority ,   that   I   hazard   less   nonsense with   young   Persons   than   I   would   with the   gravest   Philosophers .   I   observe   that the   generality   aim   at   having   the   Esteem of   their   Superiors ,   &   the   love   of   their   inferiors , this   seems   to   be   striving   against   the current   of   human   inclinations   &   affections ; for   we   are   not   naturaly   disposed   to   esteem What   is   below   us ,   or   love   what   is   above   us , so   not   to   impose   a   hard   task   on   weak   powers , I   reverse   my   aim ,   &   endeavour   to   be   respected by   those   of   inferior ,   &   beloved   by   those   of superior   talents   and   understanding ,   &   by   this means   I   have   acquired   some   authority   with those   I   should   direct ,   &   have   enjoy'd   great   indulgence from   those   who   would   naturaly   have   thought me   undeserving   of   their   attention .   You   will understand   by   this ,   that   in   my   present Society ,   my   conversation   is   un   peu   guindé &   that   I   should   be   glad   to   unbend   my mind   with   my   Friend   Mrs   Carter ,   or   if they   were   alive ,   her   Master   Plato ,   or   her Friend   Socrates . My   little   Man   had   a   delightfull   airing upon   your   Horse   this   morning .   Miss   Gregory rode   her   sober   Palfrey   at   ye   same   time . The   weather   is   charming .   The   Nightingales gave   a   fine   Concert   in   our   Woods   last night ,   but   as   I   had   some   symptoms   of   a   cold   ,   my little   Gregory   intreated   me   not   to   sit   with my   windows   open   to   listen ,   &   as   I   should expect   she   would   not ,   contrary   to   my   advice , listen   to   the   articulated   notes   of   a   love   laboured song   from   the   two   legged   animal   without feathers ,   if   any   danger   might   be   lurking , I   could   not   do   less   than   obey   her   prudent warning ,   so   lost   the   serenade . Now   my   dear   Madam   do   you   I   know   what I   mean   by   this   rural   epistle   this   Pastoral tale   of   boys   &   girls   &   Nightingales ?   Why   truly that   you   shd   send   me   a   Town   Eclogue ;   inform me   what   is   doing   in   the   great   World ,   &   ye   gay World ,   &   what   comprehends   both ,   the   Wicked World . My   most   affectte   compts   attend   Mrs   Hancock Miss   Gregory   &   my   Nephew   hope   you   will   accept of   their   best   respects .   I   am   my   Dear   Madam Ever   yours   E Montagu 
BC_1776_EMONTAGU_EV_2	Sandleford   May     My   dear   Madam How   dare   you   say   that   you   were   at home   on   Sunday   evening ,   &   had   the   Provost   of   Eton   & so   many   of   my   agreable   friends ,   but   I   was   not   of the   Party ?   I   scorn   your   words !   I   never   am   absent from   my   dear   Sylph   &   such   an   assembly .   I   was   not with   you   in   flesh   &   blood ,   in   a   gross   vulgar   manner , but   my   spirit   was   hovering   about   ye   blue   room . At   such   an   assembly   ye   more   spiritual   one   is   ye   more worthy ,   so   a   City   Feast   indeed   one   must   assist   with all   ye   grossieres   of   matter ;   the   bodily   organs     are perfectly   necessary   to   digest   venison ,   or   even   the   more delicate   dainties   Callipash   &   Callipee ;   but   learning ,   witt , &   sentiment   make   ye   entertainment   of   ye   mind ;   the   Aldermans paunch   is   not   required   to   receive   metaphysical aliment .   It   is   true ,   that   some   times crudities   will   arise   from   ye   feast   of   Reason and   the   flow   of   soul ,   &   ye   unworthy   Guest   rises   from   it   rather puffed   up   than   nourish'd .   Perhaps   even the   witt ,   &   sense ,   &   learning ,   of   ye   B'p of   Peterborough ,   &   the   Provost   may   have turn d   to   mere   flatulencies   in   me ,   but as   neither   they   nor   I   can   help   it ,   we   will say   no   more   of   that . I   am   angry   with   ye   Brutes   who   could   think of   insulting   ye   poor   Lady .   It   is   very   rude to   make   a   Lady   receive   a   kiss   from   a   Man because   she   does   not   like   him ,   more   uncivil still   because   she   is   suspected   to   like   him , &   if   she   neither   liked   nor   disliked   him   still kissing   is   improper   in   itself .   In   good Queen   Besses   romping   days ,   &   in   the Court   of   James's   Nan :   of   Denmark   such things   were   permitted .   But   the   Lady   who ever   she   is ,   shd   have   shewn   a   sullen   contempt of   ye   affront   rather   than   anger ,   &   never again   have   ventured   into   such   rude   society . Really   ye   maccaronies   wd   be   more   troublesome than   fleas   &   flies   in   a   hot   climate   if   they were   allow'd   to   fix   upon   a   Ladys   lips whenever   they   pleased .   I   suppose   there   is   not one   Maccaroni   in   a   hundred   that   could muster   up   might   for   a   smack . If   you   could   see   my   little   man   on   your   little horse ,   you   wd   say   ye   Centaur   not   fabulous was   a   very   pretty   Creature .   You   say   I   did not   tell   you   of   ye   new   Edition   of   my   Essay , indeed   my   dear   Sylph   I   did   not   think   it a   matter   of   importance   enough   to   mention it .   As   it   has   pass'd   through   four   editions I   might   by   this   time   have   made   it   more correct   but   I   think   it   always   betrays   a Authors   partiality   to   his   Work   if   he   is   in dressing   &   pranking   it   out .   so   it   appears just   as   you   saw   it ,   only   my     Dialogues , before   publish d   with   Ld   Lyttelton ,   are   put into   ye   Volume .   They   will   appear   better   there than   when   compared   with   those   of   greater merit .   Give   my   love   to   Mrs   Carter ,   no ,   do   not take   ye   trouble ,   for   she   has   had   it   all   long   ago , &   ye   Creature   is   so   faultless   one   never   can   get a   bit   of   it   back   again .   Miss   Gregory   on   all occasions   &   Mr   Matthew   ever   but   especially   on horse   back   are   yr   most   devoted .   We   have   health , liberty ,   tranquillity ,   &   fine   weather   here but   as   the   Sylph   is   not   here ,   much   is   wanting . I   have   not   yet   fixed   any   time   for   my   return to   London   but   propose   certainly   not   to   leave Sandleford   next   week .   I   am   always   wth   tenderest affection   yrs Eliz   Montagu Best   respects   to   Mrs   Hancock You   will   be   glad   to   hear I   am   in   perfect   health . 
BC_1776_EMONTAGU_EV_3	Sunday   ye     May   /   And   so   my   dear   Friend   while I   was   grieving   you   had   forgotten   &   complaining you   neglected   me ,   your   sweet   &   kind   epistle   was travelling   to   &   from   Abingdon .   Ld   Soreham   had   not added   to   my   name   &   Sandleford   near   Newbury &   I   &   Sandleford   being   obscure   &   unknown ,   &   Abingdon having   the   honour   to   send   Representatives   to Parliament ,   it   was   deem d   of   all   ye   Towns   in Berks   ye   most   worthy   of   Mrs   Veseys   letter ,   from thence   it   was   returnd   again   to   London ,   &   I   received only   yesterday   in   ye   evening . I   am   mightily charmed   with   ye   Chart   of   your   Voyages   &   Travels , but   as   my   Friend   a   very   few   years   will   make   me   an   old Witch ,   I   will   defer   such   a   Tour   till   I   can   make it   most   commodiously   &   speedily   on   a   broomstick by   that   means   I   shall   avoid   being   very   sea   sick in   the   tedious   passage   between   Brighthelmstone and   Dieppe ,   or   being   overturnd   in   my   Carriage in   passing   over   Mont   Jura ,   &   ten   thousand   inconveniences &   discomforts   which   wd   attend   a   long journey   through   barbarous   places .   I   honour   the Swiss   Cantons   infiniment   ,   but   a   little   of   ye   gay conversation   of   Paris ,   with   ye   Opera   Comique ,   & la   Comedie   Italienne   ,   will   be   rather   more   agreable to   my   taste   at   present .   I   have   seen   all   ye   august beauties   &   terrible   Graces   of   a   Mountainous Country   having   travell'd   through   ye   wildest parts   of   Scotland .   However   if   I   had   the   prospect of     or     years   of   life   before   me ,   I   shd   embrace such   a   scheme   very   eagerly ,   but   I   have   at   my   age but   a   short   period   to   expect ,   &   must   fill   it   up with   more   interesting   objects .   If   I   ever   climb   a mountain   it   will   not   be   to   see   a   Swiss   Town . Imperial   Rome ,   ye   Queen   of   Citties ,   shall   never receive   such   an   affront   from   me ,   The   Fasces of   the   Consuls ,   the   Diadem   of   ye   Emperors ,   ye Tiara   of   ye   Popes   deserve   more   respect .   Long   journeys fatigue   me   extreamly ,   as   I   never   sleep   in   an   Inn and   the   number   of   Servants   &   Carriages   which I   must   have   to   attend   me ,   &   those   I   carry   with me ,   wd   be   very   embarassing .   From   Calais   to   Paris is   not   a   longer   journey   than   from   London   to   my House   in   Northumberland .   I   may   make   short excursions   from   Paris ,   &   if   all   circumstances concurred   I   might   be   induced   to   pass   ye   alps in   order   to   pass   a   Winter   at   Rome ,   but   I   had rather   be   metamorphosed   into   a   Coach   Wheel   than spend     months   in   continual   travelling .   However I   wd   climb   Mont   Jura   to   see   you ,   if   we   cd   not   as well   meet   in   Richmond   or   Hampstead   Hill . As   to   ye   Swiss   Doctor ,   I   thank   God   I   have   no   occasion for   him   for   I   was   never   in   better   health   in   my life .   I   have   no   more   occasion   for   this   Conjuror   of a   Doctor   to   tell   me   how   to   be   well ,   than   for   a Fortune   Teller   to   tell   me   where   to   find   a   purse   of money .   The   quiet   &   fresh   air   of   ye   Country   has done   me   infinite   service .   I   am   charmd   with   ye delightfull   picture   you   have   drawn   of   Switzerland . but   after   all   do   not   the   Inhabitants   of   those   fine Mountains   gladly   quit   them   to   get   a   red   Coat &   six   pence   a   day   in   any   Army   that   will   pay   them ? &   do   not   those   happy   Inhabitants   of   those   Vallies leave   their   Arcadian   plains   for   any   dirty   City where   they   can   get   bread .   The   liberty   which   a   Man sells   so   cheap ,   &   ye   rural   felicity   &   simplicity   he   forsakes so   readily ,   are   not   like   the   liberty   &   Ease   of   English subjects .   Paris ,   Rome ,   &   Vienna ,   are   ye   places   I   wish to   see .   I   expect   little   pleasure   from   Society   but   in the   Capital   of   a   great   Empire ,   &   when   the   spirit   of adventure   decays   fatigue   &   dangers   affright   one . I   hope   you   will   come   to   Paris   in   July ,   &   there   consider your   plan   &   settle   yr   route . I   think   Mr   le   Taxier seems   entirely   cleard   of   all   that   was   laid   to   his charge ,   indeed   there   appeard   so   much   of   malice in   ye   accusation   it   never   made   any   impression on   me . After   all   I   have   said   against   climbing   Mountains &   descending   precipices   I   might   submit   to   the   labour &   the   hazard   as   means   to   something   I   desired ,   but   when they   make   ye   sum   of   ye   undertaking   I   decline   the   pleasures that   accompany   them .   It   is   not   in   the   hurry   of   a   journey and   amidst   the   babble   of   fellow   travellers ,   the   cracks   of Postillions   Whips ,   &   ye   attendance   of   a   number   of   Servants that   I   cd   taste   the   solemn   silence   of   the   Forrest ,   ye awfull   brow   of   a   Mountain ,   or   the   echo   repeating the   hoarse   murmur   of   a   Torrent .   If   you   &   I   could sit   together   under   the   shade   of   the   Mountain Pine   we   should   enjoy   the   luxurious   melancholly of   the   solemn   scene ,   but   unless   we   could   rise   on ye   pinions   of   ye   Eagle   we   shd   be   teized   with   our attendants   &   encumberd   with   baggage ,   &   our metaphysicals   enjoyments   wd   be   spoild   by vulgar   attentions . Pray   make   my   most   affectte   /   compts   to   Mrs   Hancock .   I   am   my   Dear   Madam with   most   perfect   &   entire   affection Yours E   Montagu Mr   Addison   says   a   Woman never   discloses   her   mind   but   in a   postscript   but   I   protest   ye   postscript   to   yr   last explains   little .   I   find   in   it   these   words     acres     acres 
BC_1776_EMONTAGU_EV_4	Sept   ye     My   dear   Friend In   this   bustling   busy   World   it   is   not easy   to   think   what   one   should   write ,   impossible to   recollect   what   one   has   written .   I   believe   that I   told   you ,   in   my   last   letter ,   I   had   been   at   l'Academie francoise   on   St   Louis   day .   Discourses   on   subjects of     are   read   by   the   Academicians relative   to   ye   subject   on   which   the   Poets   are to   deliver   their   verses   to   be   judged   by   the   Academy , who   bestows   the   prize   on   him   whose   work is   most   approved .   I   know   my   dear   Sylph   will be   impatient   to   be   informed   of   what   the Poets   produced ,   &   the   Academicians   said .   For tho   you   are   superior   to   the   ordinary   objects   of female   curiosity ,   you   inherit ,   in   full   force ,   our general   Mothers   vehement   desire   to   pluck the   fruit   of   the   Tree   of   Knowledge .   From   ye dapper   in   douze ,   to   the   Pumpkin   in   Folio , nothing   comes   amiss   to   you .   However ,   if   what I   collected   for   you   among   the   French   Beaux exprits   should   want   flavour   &   piquancy ,   dont blame   entirely   the   Academy   where   it   grew ,   nor your   humble   servant   who   gatherd   it ,   but   remember , that   not   being   forbidden ,   it   cannot   have the   zest ,   nor   the   odour ,   nor   the   savour   of   Eve's Apple . The   Academicians   were   seated   around   a   table , behind   them   rows   upon   rows ,   sat ,   or   stood ,   the Audience ,   or   more   properly   speaking   the   Spectators , for   in   what   Country   are   there   not   more who   go   to   see   Publick   Orations   than   to   hear them ?   Le   Chevalier   de   Chastelux   ( whose   name   I   have   before mentiond   to   you ,   but   guided   by   my   ear   mispelt ) open'd   the   Session   in   a   very   ingenious   &   elegant manner .   Two   Rival   bards   presented   their translations   of   the   parting   of   Hector   &   Andromache at   the   Scean   Gate ,   when   little   Astyanax was   affrighted   at   the   plumes   on   his   Father's   Helmet In   these   happier   days   an   Heir   apparent of   family   &   fashion   wd   have   been   so   familiarized to   feathers   by   Mama's   cap ,   he   wd   not shrink   at   the   Crest   of   the   Gorgon   bearing the   most   belligerent   quills   of   the   Porcupine . However   I   only   remark   to   you   en   passant for   the   honour   of   the   Age ,   that   the   sons   of Ancient   Heroes   were   not   so   well   trained as   the   Daughters   of   our   Heroines .   What Modern   Miss   would   not   have   seiz'd   the   plumed   Helmet &   boldy   put   it   on ?   Of   what   are   our   boys   afraid   or   Gods ashamed ?   oh !   it   is   wise   in   Parents   to   give   little Misses   &   little   Masters   audacity .   But   to   proceed to   the   translations   that   were   read ;   one   of   them was   by   the   Audience   thought   greatly   superior to   the   other ,   but   in   both   Hector   was   much   polishd by   his   Travels   in   France ;   he   did   not   send   his Dame   home   to   mind   her   Household   business ,   and mend   little   Stys   bibs ,   as   to   Madme   Andromaque , she   was   most   loquaciously   dolente   like   ye   Widow in   our   grief   ala   mode   then   for   Monsieur   son   fils he   was   nothing   like   the   ignorant ,   raw ,   blubbering , boy   in   Homer .   It   was   vastly   pretty   to   have   him so   unnaturaly   natural ,   so   very   simple   without simplicity ,   &   reason   about   the   Helmet   because he   could   not   reason .   If   a   man   was   to   study   to   be naive   for   an   hundred   years   he   cd   not   hit   it   better , and   so   the   Audience   clapped   exceedingly ,   &   divided the   prize   between   the   two   Poets .   Had   Homer himself   been   there   he   would   not   certainly   have got   one   sprig   of   Lawrel .   Old   Shakespear   &   he must   be   content   with   the   immortal   Garlands with   which   great   Nature   crownd   them ,   they are   ye   evergreens   of   time   gather d   in   her universal   common   field ,   where   genius   ranges untroubled ;   not   cull'd   and   pick'd   in   the   nice parterre   or   hot   House ,   where   Regions   &   seasons are   confounded   &   blended . After   the   Poets   had receivd   the   prize   l   Abbe   Arnauld   made   a   discourse on   the   Utility   of   studying   &   imitating   the   Classicks , &   said   much   in   praise   of   original   Genius ,   but gave   an   oblique   hint ,   that   genius   never   bloomd North   of   the   most   Northern   part   of   France   & that   that   Men   of   Genius   must   not   study   certain barbarians ;   but   this   was   done   so   gently ,   &   obliquely , that   one   was   not   obliged   to   understand   it &   I   wd   not   seem   to   do   so . Then   rose   Monr   D'alembert   to   read   a   most blackguard   abusive   invective   of   Monr   de Voltaires   against   Shakespear ,   the   translation of   whose   works   he   apprehended   wd   spoil   ye taste   of   ye   french   Nation .   He   attributed   to Shakespear   many   things   he   never   said ,   he gatherd   together   many   things   the   rudeness of   the   age   allowd   him   to   say ,   &   with   a   few mauvaises   plaisanteries   seasond   ye   discourse with   as   much   mauvaise   foy   he   gave   an account   of   ye   Tragedy   of   Gorbuc ,   &   represented it   as   ye   taste   of   ye   Nation   in   Drama tho   not   ten   people   have   for   these   hundred years   read   Gorboduc .   This   trash   of   Monsieur Voltaires   answerd   the   great   purpose   of   his life ,   to   raise   a   momentary   laugh   at   things that   are   good ,   &   a   transient   scorn   of   Men much   superior   to   himself ,   but   I   must   do that   justice   to   the   Academy   &   Audience ,   they seem d   in   general   displeased   at   ye   paper   read . I   was   ask d   by   an   Academician   if   I   wd   answer this   piece   of   Voltaires ,   &   did   not   doubt   but I   could   do   it   very   well .   I   said   Mr   l'Abbé Arnauld   had   done   it   much   better   than I   could ,   in   ye   praises   he   had   given   to Original   genius ,   &   said   ye   benefits   arising   from the   study   of   them ,   that   I   remembered   years   ago   in   the   same   Academy ,   Old   Homer had   met   with   ye   same   treatment   with Shakespear ,   that   they   now   did   justice   to Homer ,   I   did   not   doubt   but   they   wd   do   so to   Shakespear ,   for   that   great   Genius's survived   those   who   set   up   to   be   their Criticks ,   or   more   absurdly   to   be   their Rivals .   Many   of   the   Academicians   have have   declared   their   dislike   of   what   was   done , that   it   was   not   only   unjust   to   Shakespear but   unworthy   of   the   Academy .   Mr   D'alembert then   pronounced   an   eloge   of   Destouches   whose   Comedies   are   reckond   next   to   Molieres There   was   a   great   deal   of   spirit   &   ingenuity in   the   eloge ,   &   some   anecdotes   of   Destouches that   were   interesting .   Indeed   every   thing but   the   paper   of   Voltaire   was   very   ingenious , &   such   as   did   honour   to   the   speaker   &   the Assembly . The   custom   of   clapping   every   bon mot   that   falls   from   the   Speaker ,   the   Pleader , or   the   Preacher ,   will   entirely   ruin   their eloquence .   I   was   surprized   to   hear   the   Pleaders clapp d   in   a   Civil   Cause ,   I   was   sorry   to   hear the   speakers   clapped   in   a   learned   assembly , but   I   was   shock'd   to   hear   ye   Preacher   clappd in   the   Chapel   of   St   Louis .   The   good   man   divided his   discourse   into   parts ,   as   soon   as   he   had finish'd   ye   first   part   the   Congregation   clappd more   than   we   do   at   ye   play   House .   At   ye conclusion   they   dismissed   the   Preacher with   what   is   thought   here   the   greatest   of all   blessings ,   a   thunder   of   applause .   I   must   tell you   at   the   same   time ,   for   I   should   hate   to   misrepresent any   people ,   especially   a   people   from whom   I   have   received   great   civilities ,   &   for   whom I   have   due   admiration ,   I   was   assured   that   ye Sermon   on   St   Louis   was   clappd   as   being   a Political   Affair .   However   ye   place   was   consecrated le   Bon   Dieu   was   on   ye   altar ,   &   Mass   was   afterwards performd .   In   one   of   the   Churches   ye   other   day the   Te   Deum   being   well   perform d   was   exceedingly clapped   as   I   was   assured . I   suppose   you   think   no   Poet   here   deigns   to   string his   Lyre   in   praise   of   Miss   Gregorys   blooming charms   &   my   autumnal   perfections   to   convince you   we   are   not   so   neglected   as   you   imagine I   have   enclosed   a   very   pretty   copy   of   verses   of le   Chevalier   de   Coliniere . I   expect   Ld   &   Lady   Hillsborough   &   Ld   Eglentoune to   dinner   &   also   the   celebrated   Diderot . I   dined   last   week   at   Monsr   de   Buffons   & he   has   promised   to   dine   with   me   next   week with   some   other   of   the   Academy   &   also   La Comtesse   de   Marchais   & c   all   very   agreable people .   I   suppd   with   her   last   night   &   to   night shall   sup   at   Madme   Neckars .   Monsieur   de   Buffons is   very   communicative   &   agreable   &   I   have   taken a   great   liking   to   Monsr   Thomas   who   has   wrote very   well   on   a   delicate   subject   Woman ,   but you   may   know   him   better   by   his   eloges   on   many celebrated   men .   I   have   received   the   mirrors   but le   Chevalier   de   Luxembourg   has   been   at Versailles   ever   since   his   return   so   I   have   not seen   him   yet .   I   do   not   know   whether   you   receive my   letters   or   not ,   pray   mention   ye   dates . I   must   tell   you   you   are   a   lazy   correspondent you   shake   a   few   letters   out   upon   a   piece   of paper   &   call   them   an   answer   to   my   long epistles .   I   was   not   very   well   last   week   but   am   in good   health   again .   I   continue   my   purpose   to set   out   early   in   October   for   England .   Remember to   direct   to   me   to   Chevalier   Lambert   &   Banqures a   Paris .   Make   my   best   compts   &   present   my sincerest   good   wishes   to   Mrs   Hancock   Mr   &   Mrs Dunbar   Genl   Paoli   &   Mr   Evesham   &   give   a   kiss to   my   Godson . I   am   my   dear   Friend   yours   E M 
BC_1776_EMONTAGU_SS_1	May     My   dear   Sister I   heartily   pity   what   you   must have   felt   at   ye   confirmation   of   a   certain   very   foolish affair ,   The   first   hint   I   received   of   it   from   an   anonymous letter   absolutely   gave   me   a   fever .   I   have   heard   of   Men who   have   dyed   of   a   swearing   fever ,   but   Ladies   you know   cannot   have   ye   disorder   attended   by   such an   irruption ,   &   anger   like   another   other   distempers   ,   is   dangerous in   the   degree   it   is   thrown   out .   I   took   my   temper at   last ,   thinking   ye   letter   misrepresented   ye   case ,   &   that   it   it was   an   affair   for   which   a   Man does   penance   only   once   in   a   white   sheet ,   but   it seems   it   is   of   that   sort   for   which   a   Man   does   penance all   his   Life .   I   knew   of   this   affair   some   days   before I   left   London ,   but   was   enjoynd   secrecy .   For   my   own part ,   I   wish   the   poor   Man   may   be   much   more   happy than   he   has   been   prudent ,   but   that   is   what   rarely happens .   I   believe   she   is   a   good   sort   of   Woman ,   &   if he   can   forget   all   ye   improprieties   he   has   committed for   her   he   may   live   easily   &   comfortably .   When   I   think of   the   vanity   &   pride   with   which   I   once   used   to   to   appear   at   Canterbury   Races   where   our   Father   & Mother   were   ye   envy   of   every   body ,   &   think   of   ye figure   the   family   makes   at   present ,   it   strikes   me deeply .   I   thank   my   stars   my   property   is   not   in Kent ,   I   never   desire   to   shew   myself   there   to   set people   to   tell   ye   Roman   Comique   &   all   ye   uncommon   things   that   have befallen   our   family .   Papa   who   hates   those   who do   him   honour ,   will   I   hope   in   ye   same   spirit   do &   say   something   very   handsome   for   poor   Charles   on   this occasion .   As   for   me ,   I   shall   behave   with   great   civility to   them ,   &   act   with   friendship ,   for   a   Man   is   not   to   ask his   Sisters   consent   to   marry ,   &   in   marrying   ill ,   tho he   disgraces   his   family   to   a   certain   degree ,   it   is   not to   be   expected   that   he   shd   have   a   more   nice   sense of   honour   for   others   than   for   himself .   His   youth &   want   of   knowledge   of   the   World ,   &   not   having   the countenance   &   protection   of   a   Father   &   Mother   & a   creditable   home ,   but   being   by   some   particular circumstances   thrown   into   low   company   a   great deal   excuse   him .   I   wish   the   pangs   of   his   delivery   were over ,   poor   thing   I   pity   him   with   all   my   heart . Alas !   Poor   Benedict   ye   married   man !   It   is   impossible to   warn   my   Nephews   against   such   sort   of   marriages &   I   dread   ye   example .   They   have   a   very   improper way   at   Lincolns   Inn   fields   of   talking   of   ye   beauty of   Girls   to   my   little   Man ,   &   he   always   comes   home full   of   ye   subject .   My   dear   Papa   used   to   do   the   same . If   my   Brothers   were   religious   men   I   cd   excuse   them , but   never   to   go   to   Church   but   just   on   ye   occasion in   which   a   Wise   Man ,   actuated   by   ye   motives of   this   World   wd   not   go   thither ,   seems   a   judgment upon   Sabbath   breaking .   I   cannot   account   for   it   any other   way ,   but   that   same   Sabbath   breaking ,   which many   an   unhappy   Youth   at   ye   Gallows   confesses brought   him   to   a   shamefull   end .   I   really   was   so deceived   by   Charles   unembarassed   Countenance   whenever I   mentioned   marriage   to   him ,   that   I   had   expell'd   ye   suspicion ye   horrid   anonymous   letter   gave   me .   There   is was   something generous   &   delicate   in   the   proceedings   of   his   Wife   in   not claiming   her   rank   &   name   till   the   Childs   interest   required   it There   is   one   nasty   thing   in   human   nature   which   makes these   family   disasters   more   terrible .   The   offender   never forgives   ye   offended ,   you   may   pardon   your   relation   but he   is   lost   to   you ,   he   fancies   you   feel   his   fault   more   sensibly than   ye   rest   of   ye   World   as   you   are   more   hurt   by it ,   &   therefore   rarely   is   a   cordial   friend .   However   my   dear Sister   all   these   mortifications   &   disgraces   affect   only   a   short   period of   a   short   life ,   &   it   is   not   worth   while   to   be   very   serious about   what   shall   decorate   or   disgrace   ye   little   theatre in   which   our   petite   peice   is   to   be   acted .   I   am   sorry that   as   this   affair   is   to   be   produced   he   shd   delay   it   as he   will   be   unhappy   till   it   is   over . I   am   much   ye   better   for   ye   Country .   I   was   at   Newtown Church   on   Sunday ,   &   ye   people   congratulated   White on   my   looking   so   well ,   &   all   ye   poor   people   I   have   seen have   told   me   they   are   glad   to   see   me   so   brave   &   well . The   quiet   of   this   place   after   ye   hurley   burley   of   London is   delightfull .   Since   I   came   out   of   Town   Madme   Necker ye   Genoese   Ministers   Lady   at   Paris   has   been   at   my   door in   Hillstreet ,   she   is   reckond   one   of   ye   most   learned   Ladies in   Europe ,   she   brought   a   letter   of   recommendation to   me   from   Paris ,   &   I   am   really   sorry   she   did not   arrive   till   I   had   left   London .   I   shall   be solicitous   to   hear   of   poor   Charles's   happy delivery .   I   hope   my   unknown   Neice   will be   a   good   girl ,   if   she   is   as   good   humoured as   her   Father   we   shall   like   her .   I   hope   as Charles   has   not   offended   my   Father by   making   a   good   &   profitable   alliance ye   old   Gentleman   will   not   abuse   him at   ye   Coffee   house .   I   am   curious   to   know what   he   will   say   on   ye   occasion .   I   hope he   will   not   be   cross   to   poor   Charles . You   will   be   glad   to   hear   our   poor   Brother John   is   in   good   health   &   very   serene . he   is   grown   very   plump .   He   has   apparently more   sense   &   apprehension   than   he had .   He   was   here   ye   day   of   my   arrival and   saw   ye   Cloth   laid   for   my   dinner , &   Robt   told   him   he   wd   bring   him   to see   me ,   but   did   not   mean   to   do   it   that day ,   but   the   poor   thing   it   seems   expected it ,   &   at   night   told   Robt   he   was   a deceiving   blockhead ,   for   he   had   not   carried him   to   Lady   Montagu   as   he   calls   me . I   took   ye   opportunity   when   Matt   was out   on   horseback   to   invite   him ,   and I   was   walking   in   ye   Garden expecting   he   wd   come   in   by   ye   Gravel Walk ,   but   they   brought   him   through ye   Hall ,   &   carried   him   into   ye   dressing room ,   where   not   finding   him me   he   gave signs   of   discontent ,   &   said   he   never   hurt Ladies .   I   ran   up   as   soon   as   I   heard he   was   in   ye   dressing   room ,   he   said   in his   manner ,   that   he   was   not   mad , that   he   sometimes   utterd   a   foolish maxim .   I   treated   him   with   some   Wine &   china   oranges ,   he   sat   near   an   hour , &   then   went   away   very   peaceably .   I   sent him   some   asparagus   yesterday   &   blanc manger   to   day .   He   talkd   incoherently sometimes   in   my   dressing   room ,   &   a good   deal   about   Bondstreet .   I   gave   him a   little   snuff   box .   He   often   repeats   at   home that   I   dont   come   from   Bondstreet .   I   assure you   he   does   not   look   very   pleasant when   that   said   Bondstreet   is   uppermost in   his   mind ,   but   in   general   he   was   very good   humoured   &   smiling .   I   intend   to   call   on him   tomorrow .   When   do   you   expect   my   Bror &   Sister   William .   Is   my   new   discoverd   Neice   as   tall   as her   Father   or   as   short   as   her   Mother .   I   believe   you   have not   seen   her   since   she   was   at   Mrs   Cotes's ,   It   is   great   pity as   we   have     Nephews   there   are   but     Greenlands   left   for   us I   wish   Mrs   Smith   of   Hayton   had   been   struck   dumb   before she   made   her   piteous   harangues   or   that   I   had   been deaf   to   ye   tale   of   woe   for   once .   Cupid   is   a   comical   boy but   he   never   devised   before   any   thing   so   drole   as   Brors   marrying     Sisters   in   this   fashion .   It   is   a   fine   subject for   ye   Gossips   at   Canterbury .   I   hope   if   my   Bror   Robinson marries   it   will   be   to   some   fair   Dalilah   of   ye   Philistines who   will   cut   off   his   hair   that   ye   family   may   get some   credit   back   again .   If   you   can   contrive   it   get   poor Charles   to   own   this   affair   for   anxiety   of   mind   is   very bad   for   his   complaint .   I   dont   see   why   he   shd   not   bring his   Wife   to   London   as   she   is   frugal   she   will   not   put   him to   much   expence ;   &   it   will   mortify   her   to   be   absent from   her   deary .   Mr   Greenland   shd   give   him   all   ye   fees he   can ,   for   his   Sisters   sake ,   &   my   Bror   Morris   was   certainly ye   cause   of   ye   match ,   as   he   lent   his   name   to   one Sister   Charles   thought   he   might   do   ye   same   to   ye   other . So   between   these       Brors   he   ought   to   have   a   good deal   of   business .   My   Bror   Morris   under   promise   of   secresy acquainted   me   with   this   affair   just   before   I   left   London I   did   not   doubt   but   he   believed   it ,   but   I   flatterd   myself it   was   possibly   only   from   ye   Ladys   report   to   her   Sister   that   he spoke   tho   I   was   under   apprehensions   but   till   the   Gentleman himself   own d   it   I   was   determined   not   to   take any   measures   in   consequence   of   it   Pray   enquire   punctually &   exactly   my   Neices   Christian   name   &   let   me   know   it Poor   Mrs   Freinds   situation   is   terrible .   Her   knowing you   is   a   strong   testimony   of   a   deep   rooted   affection I   call d   ye   other   morn :   on   a   certain   Neighbour of   mine   he   is   in   perfect   health ,   chearfull ,   & smiling ,   he   came   with   me   to   ye   door   of   ye   Chaise Miss   Gregory   was   amazed   to   see   him   grown so   fat   &   fresh   colourd .   He   was   at   dinner   on fish   &   a   breast   of   Veal   when   I   went   in .   He   is   now rarely   out   of   temper ,   he   is   very   fond   of   Patt     takes   her   in   his   arms .   He   walks   out     unless   it   rains .   I   have   enjoyd   an   uncommon   share of   health   ever   since   I   came   to   Sandleford .   I   take   an   airing every   day   which   terribly   devours   my   mornings .   I   hope   you have   received   ye   tribute   of   a   turkey   &   cream   from   my   Farm . I   am   glad   to   hear   all   our   Kin   is   in   good   health .   Mrs Robinson   said   my   Bror   Morris   had   been   ill . I   wish   yr   cold   was   gone   &   yr   melancholly   attendance on   yr   unhappy   Neighbour   at   an   end   &   then   I   shd flatter   myself   you   might   continue   to   feel   ye   good   effect of   yr   summers   excursion   which   certainly   did   you great   service .   I   am   most   affectly your   most   affectly E Montagu 
BC_1776_EMONTAGU_SS_2	friday   ye   My   dear   Sister I   intended   to   have   been   with   you yesterday   morning   but   was   prevented   by   receiving a   letter   ye   night   before   that   my   little   Matt at   Mr   Burrows   was   not   well ,   so   I   went   to Hagleigh   &   brought   him   to   London .   His   disorder seemd   chiefly   to   arise   from   his   stomach ,   so he   has   taken   a   little   gentle-emetick   this morning   &   is   now   well   &   at   play   with   his marbles .   As   I   am   to   dine   at   ye   Duchess   of Beauforts   to   meet   some   Foreigners   to   day I   shall   not   be   able   to   get   to   you ,   &   tomorrow I   am   to   dine   out ,   &   in   ye   morning   to go   to   Mr   Duanes .   I   wanted   to   inform   you that   I   have   apply d   for   ye   Kings   sign   manual for   leave   for   my   nephew   Matt   to   change his   name   to   Montagu .   He   will   change a   good   name   for   a   better ,   &   as   there   is   but one   precedent   in   ye   Montagu   family of   such   marriages   as   ours   has   proceeded , &   my   poor   Cousin   Wortley   was   only   years   of   age ,   &   press'd   by   hunger   as   well as   another   ignoble   passion ,   I   hope   my nephew   Montagu   will   not   make   such an   alliance .   I   lived   in   a   prodigious   hurley burley   ever   since   I   saw   you ,   &   to   thicken ye   plot ,   Edw   Brown   came   some   days   since , &   Mr   Black   will   be   here   on   Sunday . You   are   more   likely   than   I   am   to   know for   what   reason   the   P:   of   Wales   family has   undergone   alterations .   There   is   but one   Mr   Smelt   in   ye   World ,   &   I   grieve   ye Princes   lose   him .   But   in   this   unstable World   who   expects   stability   in   a   Court ? Best   love   to   Miss   Arnold ,   &   most   affecte   respects to   Mrs   Cutts .   I   saw   my   Father ,   on   Wensday morning   he   is   well   .   I   did   not   tell   him   of   ye   operation I   was   going   to   perform   on   his   Grandsons name ,   but   cd   not   help   feeling   some pleasure   that   I   thought   I   had   by   it answerd   in   some   degree   his   insinuations on   my   account   at   his   Coffee   house . I   have   great   pleasure   in   paying   respect where   gratitude   is   due ,   &   in   escaping to   ye   utmost   of   my   power   from   the honour   of   certain   alliances . Miss   Gregory   sends   best   compts   yr   Nephew his   duty .   You   will   be   glad   to   hear   that   in spite   of   all   my   indiscretions   I   am   very   well . Poor   Mr   Blondel   by   going   out   in   a   cold Northeast   wind   got   a   return   of   his   sore throat   much   worse   than   at   first ,   he   is better   but   keeps   his   bed .   My   little   Man   tells me   my   Bror   has   carried   his   Wife   to Canterbury   but   I   imagine   he   mistakes as   poor   Charles   did   not   seem   in   a   hurry to   enjoy   the   settled   comforts   of   ye   conjugal   state I   hope   you   are   better   for   ye   south   west   breeze   I   was   not   satisfied with   yr   looks   when   I   was   at   Chelsea .   I   am   ever   most   affectte   Sister E Montagu 
BC_1776_EMONTAGU_SS_3	Paris July   ye     My   dear   Sister I   hope   you   received   my   letter   from   Calais . Our   Land   journey   thank   God   was   as   safely   tho   not so   speedily   perform'd .   We   set   out   from   Calais   on monday   noon ,   &   arrived   here   on   thursday   night   after eleven   o'clock .   the   weather   was   very   fine   but   the journey   very   unpleasant ,   the   horses   are   so   bad ,   ye postillions   so   awkward ,   the   rope   harness   so   rotten , the   Inns   so   nasty ,   that   I   think   no   one   wd   ever travel     miles   in   this   Country   if   they   cd   help   it . I   hope   our   government   will   never   take   ye   posts into   its   hands ,   it   is   too   small   an   object   for   Kings . Would   you   believe   his   Most   Christian   Majesty made   a   poor   widow   Woman   pay   for     horses tho   he   often   furnishd   her   with   only   ,   instead   of   horses   in   ye   Coach   &     in   ye   Chaise   &     for   my   horse   men   I   cd   sometimes only   get     for   ye   Coach   &     for   my   Men   but   as I   shd   have   had   them   if   they   had   been   there I   paid   ye   same .   ye   same   weight   still   say   they say   they   is   to   be   drawn   by   ye   Grand   Monarques horses   but   alas   not   with   ye   same   speed .   By   getting out   early   &   getting   in   late   we   perform d   our   journey &   for   my   part   I   never   slept   from   ye   time   I   left   Hillstreet   yet   I   did   not   suffer   much .   I   lost half   a   day   at   Calais   by   there   not   being   Horses for   me   &   my   Suitte   which   occasiond   our   lying in   wretched   Inns .   The   Person   who   I   thought wd   depart   for   England   ye   day   after   tomorrow   departs   tomorrow at   break   of   day   so   I   have   only   time   to   tell   you I   am   very   well   &   have   already   met   with   infinite civilities   here ,   particulars   thereof   you   shall   have hereafter .   I   am   magnificently   lodged   but   a good   deal   tormented   with   bugs   in   ye   night . Mrs   Vesey   will   let   you   read   my   letter   to   her in   which   there   is   a   full   account   of   our   Journey . We   are   all   well   my   Nephew   brought   a   little cough   with   him   when   he   set   out   on   his   journey &   it   is   not   gone   which   vexes   me   but   he   is   very well   &   Pennington   &   he   are   vastly   fond   of   each other   which   makes   me   very   happy .   Indeed   they are   charming   boys ,   of   a   different   turn   but   each fit   for   their   situation .   Pennington   will   make a   fortune   &   Montagu   will   grace   one .   I   take   ye last   to   be   a   more   rare   felicity   than   ye   first . We   are   very   busy   with   Masters   and   Marchandes de   Modes   .   we   shall   all   be   very   polite   before   we return .   The   City   of   Paris   is   in   some   respects   like Bristol ,   streets   narrow ,   dark ,   &   dirty ,   in   some parts   in   others   magnificent   &   fine .   Col   Drumgold comes   to   me   every   day   but   his   only   child   was   dangerously ill   when   I   came ,   &   is   but   now   out   of   danger so   I   have   not   seen   Madme   Drumgold ,   but   he   to   me   with   ye   most   affectionate   kindness .   Duc   de Nivernois   &   Madme   Rochefort   are   out   of   Town for   a   few   days ,   but   I   meet   with   so   much   kindness &   have   so   many   agreable   parties   offerd   I   know not   how   to   avail   myself   of   them   all .   Madme   Neckar came   to   Paris   from   ye   Country   to   carry   me   to her   box   at   ye   Play   to   night   but   I   had   company   I   cd   not leave .   I   am   to   dine   wth   her   at   her   House   near Paris   on   saturday   to   meet   all   ye   Beaux   esprits   . Pray   give   my   duty   to   my   Father   &   let   my   Brother know   we   are   all   well .   Montagu   wrote   yesterday but   I   believe   this   sooner .   Best   compts   to   Mrs   Cutts I   am   ever   most   affectly   yrs   E M 
BC_1777_EMONTAGU_HR	Sandleford   June     Dear   Brother It   would   be   with   much   greater   pleasure   I   should   take   up   my pen   to   tell   you   I   am   at   Sandleford ,   if   I   could   flatter   myself with   the   hope   of   alluring   you   to   it .   You   would   find   me   in   the character   of   a   Farmeress .   The   meager   condition   of   the   soil forbids   me   to   live   in   the   State   of   a   Shepherdess   Queen   which   I look   upon   as   the   highest   rural   dignity .   The   plough   the   Harrow &   the   Spade   remind   us   that   the   golden   age   is   past ,   & subsistence   depends   on   labour ,   prosperity   on   industrious application .   A   little   of   the   day ,   of   which   you   complain ,   would do   us   a   great   deal   of   good .   I   should   be   glad   to   take   my Dominions   here   from   the   Goddess   Ceres ,   to   give   them   to   the   God Pan ;   &   I   think   you   will   agree   with   me   in   that   taste ,   for whatever whereever he   presides ,   there   Natures   Republick   is   establish'd .   the   Ox   in his   Pasture ,   is   as   free ,   &   as   much   at   his   ease ,   as   the proprietor   of   the   Soil ,   &   the   days   of   the   first   are   not   more shorten'd   to   feed   the   intemperance   of   others   than   the   rich Landlords ,   by   the   indulgence   of   his   own .   I   look   upon   the Goddess   Ceres   as   a   much   less   impartial ,   &   universally   kind Deity .   The   antients   thought   they   did   her   honour   by   ascribing to   her   the   invention   of   Laws ;   we   must   consider   her   also as   the   Mother   of   Lawsuits ,   &   indeed   of   all   the division   &   dissensions   &   distinctions   among   Mankind . Naturalists   tells tell   us ,   all   the   Oaks   that   have   ever been   were   contain'd   in   the   first   acorn ,   I   believe   we   may affirm   by   the   same   mode   of   reasoning   that   all arts   &   sciences   were   contain'd   in   the   first   ear   of   Corn .   To possess   lasting   treasure   &   exclusive   property has   been   the   great   business   &   aim   of   Man .   At   Sandleford   you will   find   us   busy   in   the   cares   of   Arable   Land .   By two   little   purchases   Mr   Montagu   made   here ,   my   farm   contains six   hundred   Acres .   As   I   now   consider   it   as   Amazonian   Land ,   I affect   to   consider   the   Women   as   capable   of   assisting   in agriculture   as   much   as   the   Men ;   they   weed   my   corn ,   hoe   my turnips ,   &   set   my   Pottatoes ,   &   by   these   means   promote   the prosperity   of   their   families .   A   Landlord ,   whose   le   droit   du Seigneur   prevail'd ,   would   not   expose   the   complexions   of   his female   Vassals   to   the   Sun .   I   must   confess   my   Amazons   hardly deserve   to   be   accounted   of   the   fair   Sex ,   &   they   have   not   the resources   of   pearl   powder   &   rouge   when   the   natural   lillies   & roses   are   faded . You   are   very   polite   in   supposing   my   looks   not   so   homely   as I   described   them ,   but   tho   my   health   is   good ,   the   faded   roses do   not   revive ;   &   I   assure   you ,   I   am   always   of   the   colour   of la   feuillemorte   .   My   complexion   has   long   fallen   into   the Sere   &   yellow   leaf ,   and   I   assure   you   one   is   as   much   warned against   using   art   by   seeing   the   Ladies   of   Paris   as   the   Spartan youths   by   observing   the   effect   of   intoxicating   liquors   on   the Helots .   The   vast   quantity   of   rouge   worn   there   by   the   fine Ladies   makes   them   hideous .   As   I   always   imagine   one   is   less looked   at   by   wearing   the   uniform   of   the   Society   one   lives   in , I   allow'd   my   frizeuse   to   put   on   whatever   rouge   was   usually worn ,   but   a   few   years   ago   I   believe   my   vanity   could   not   have submitted   to   such   a   disfiguration .   As   soon   as   I   got   to   Dover   I returnd   to   my   former   complexion .   I   own   I   think   I   could   make that   complexion   a   little   better ,   by   putting   on   a   little   rouge ; but   at   my   age ,   any   appearance   of   solicitude   about   complexion is   absurd ,   &   therefore   I   remain   where   age   &   former   ill   health has   brought   me ;   &   rejoyce   however   that   I   enjoy   the   comforts   of health ,   tho   deprived   of   its   pleasing   looks . I   am   very   glad   to   find   my   Neice   has   recover'd   her   health ,   I was   much   afraid   of   a   Consumption   for   her .   She   seems   to   me   to be   a   sensible   amiable girl ,   &   to   have   the   disposition   &   qualities   which   render domestick   life   peaceable   &   chearfull .   It   is   has   given   me great   pleasure   to   hear   by   many   opportunities ,   that   your   health is   pretty   good ;   but   if   St   Anthonys   fire   should   menace   a return   remember   that   his   distemper   as   well   as his   temptation   is   most   dangerous   in   a   desart   on   Wilderness ; &   repair   to   the   City   of   Bath .   Tho   I   say   this ,   I   was   never   in my   life   more   sensible   of   the   charms   of   rural   life ,   & the   blessing   of   tranquillity ,   but   at   same   time ,   I   am   sensible my   relish   for   them   is   much   quicken'd   by   having   been   for   above a   twelvemonth   past   in   a   very   different   mode   of   life .   I   regret very   much   that   the   Emperor   did   not   come   to   Paris   last   Summer . Tho   I   suppose ,   amongst   the   french   Nobility ,   I   met   with   Men   as polite ,   amongst   the   Academicians   with   men   more   learned , ingenious ,   &   witty ,   yet   as   I   am   a   Virtuoso   in what   relates   to   the   human   character ,   &   love   to   see   how   it appears   in   various   situations ,   I   should   have   seen   an   Emperor as   an   Emperor   is   an   unique   in   human   society   at   present ,   &   the Austrian   family   has   also   had   a   strongly   marked   Personal character .   All   my   french   correspondents   assure   me ,   that   his Imperial   Majesty   veils   his   dignity ,   on   all   occasions ,   under the   character   of   Count   de   Falkenstein .   He   sleeps   at   his Ambassadors ,   but   dines   with   the   two   Noblemen   of   his   Court   who attend   him ,   at   une   Hotel   garriene .   When   he   goes   to Versailles   to   visit   his   Sister ,   he   refuses   to   Lodge   in   the Palace ,   and   lyes   at   a   Bagnio .   he   goes   sometimes   to   Versailles in   his   Coach ,   at   others   in   a     ,   or   walks . The   french ,   who   are   much   struck   with   every   thing   that   is   new , are   full   of   wonder   &   respect   &   at   the   Publick Spectacles   they   give   a   thunder   of   applause   whenever   he appears .   In   private   society   his   Majesty   is   easy   &   affable and   by   what   I   can   understand ,   glad   to   shew   he   is   more conversant   in   the   common   affairs   of   human   life   than   Princes usually   are .   The   objects   of   his   curiosity ,   &   the   subjects   of his   discourse ,   are   such   as   seem   to   indicate   he   is   a   man   of sense ,   whether   he   has   talents   for   Empire   time   must   shew , without   understanding   the   doctrine   of   chances   as   well   as   one   may   pronounce ;   the   chances   are   nearly infinite   that   he   has   not .   I   am   glad   however   Princes   begin   to travel ,   one   has   a   chance   of   meeting   these   Itinerant   Monarchs somewhere ,   &   they   amuse   at   least   as   well   as   stuff'd Eagles   or   Lions   in   a   Museum   I   was   in   great   hopes   that you   would   have   had   the   curiosity   to   have   come   to   Town   to   have heard   Ld   Chatham   in   support   of   his   Motion   the   other   day ,   & when   you   had   got   so   far   towards   Bath   you   might   have   proceeded , &   I   should   have   ye   happiness   in   seeing   you   here .   The   Primate of   Ireland   &   Sr   Willm   Robinson   were   so   good   as   to   call   on me   in   their   way   to   London .   they   staid   only   three   days .   I believe   the   Primate   will   go   to   Tunbridge   before   he   returns   to Ireland . I   believe   I   shall   not   remove   from   hence   till   ye   middle of   next   month   when   I   propose   to   make   a   visit   at   Mount Edgecumbe .   I   am   ashamed   of   this   long   letter .   I   have   an opportunity   of   sending   it   to   London   this   moment .   I   am   Dear Brother   with   most   affectte   esteem yrs   & c E Montagu 
BC_1777_EMONTAGU_MA_1	Sandleford   July   ye     Dear   Madam Your   account   of   my   dear   Neices   perfect   recovery   gave   me great   pleasure .   I   think   I   see   in   her   disposition   all   the elements   of   which   a   good   Daughter ,   Wife ,   Mother ,   Sister ,   Wife , Mistress   of   a   family ,   are   composed ,   &   from   thence   I prognosticate ,   that   she   will   make   others   happy   &   be   so herself .   As   she   was   not   the   worse   for   the   Ball   I   am   glad   she partook   of   the   pleasure   of   it ;   if   she   resembles   certain   Miss Robinson ,   who   lived   in   the   Neighbourhood   some   years   ago ,   she will   reckon   a   ball   amongst   the   first   enjoyments   of   human   life . Considering   her   state   of   health   I   do   not   know   whether   if   was very   prudent   in   her   Father   to   carry   her   there ,   but   I   am   sure it   was   very   amiable .   the   error   should   always   be   rather   on   the side   of   indulgence   one   should   consider   that   tho   there   will   be dancing   as   long   as   the   World   indures   it   is but   a   short   time   that   an   individual   will   dance .   I   have sometimes   sufferd   Montagu   to   fly   his Kite   in   a   cold   evening   in   Autumn   when   I   have   trembled   for   fear he   should   get   an   ague   because   the   Kite   season   is   short ,   &   that if   that   time   three   years   the   weather   should   be   ever   so favourable   the   opportunity   would   not   have   been   valued .   Ye fits   of   peevishness   or   gloom   or   obstinacy   I   am   very   severe because   they   are   always   contrary   to   the   happiness   of   the animal   in   all   its   stayes   of   existence .   Bad   habits   are   never   to be   indulged ,   as   they   lead   to   great   &   permanent   but   whoever   can deny   a   child   a   harmless   pleasure   &   to   taste   the   joys   peculiar to   its   season   of   life   is   more   wicked   than   Macbeth ,   who murdered   its   innocent   sleep   their   days   dreams   are   quite as   innocent   &   much   more   gay . The   warmth   of   the   weather   prevented   my   seeing   the   School for   scandal   but   every   one   agrees   with   you   to   commend   it .   Of all   the   vices   of   the   human   disposition   a   love   of   scandal   & detraction   is the   most   contemptible .   It   is   now   gone   from   the   Gossips   tea table   to   the   Press ,   &   the   Scriblers   Weekly   let   fly   their popguns   at   the   Duchess   of   Devonshires   feathers .   Her   Grace   is innocent ,   good   humoured ,   &   beautifull ,   but   these   adders   are blind   &   deaf   &   can   not   be   charmed .   However   the   scriblers   are some   of   them   &   all   of   them   hungry   but   the   circulators   of scandal   who   have   neither   hunger   for   their   excuse ,   nor   witt   to give   it   a   seasoning ,   are   sad   vermin ,   &   I   am   glad   Mr   Sheridan has   so   well   exposed   them . The   uncertainty   of   human   life   is   certainly   a   discouragement to   every   enterprize   but   to   none   less   I   think   to   building   a House ,   if   it   is   a   good   one   there   will   be   somebody   to   live   in it   &   enjoy   its   comforts ,   if   otherwise   its   inconveniences   will not   make   one   uneasy   in   the   tomb .   To   undertake   a   trust   which   by not   fulfilling   may   be   detrimental   to   some   Person   to   bring Children into   the   World   when   it   is   too   late   in   life   to   hope   to   see   them educated   &   establish'd   are   things   about   which   a   prudent   person may   hesitate   but   even   in   this   case   we   can   never   do   wrong   when we   follow   the   general   principles   by   which   the   Author   of   our nature   has   intended   we   should   be   directed .   The   shortness   & uncertainty   of   life   would   discourage   all   great   undertakes   &   as the   human   race   is   to   continue   Providence   has   order'd   we   should act   here   as   if   we   to   live   forever . We   have   had   a   series   of   the   worst   weather   since   I   came hither   that   I   ever   knew   at   this   time   of   the   year   Sir   William Temple   says   the   three   greatest   blessings   are   health   &   peace   & fine   weather ,   the   first   two   are   most   important   &   I   have enjoy'd   them   in   so   perfect   a   degree   that   I   have   well   endured the   want   of   the   third .   Dr   Robertsons   History   of America   has   amused   me   by   my   fireside   when   wind   &   rain   have combined   against   my   amusements   abroad .   A   long   deprivation   of the   quiet   joys   of   rural   life   gives   me   a   great relish   for   them   if   I   had   stayd   in   Town   the   great   numbers   of Foreigners   lately   arrived   there ,   who   have   all   brought   letters of   recommendation   to   me ,   or   wd   have   been   naturally introduced   by   my   previous   acquaintance   with   them   abroad ,   must have   taken   up   much   of   my   time   &   attention .   Lord   Shelburne calld   here   the   other   day   to   invite   me   to   Bowood   to   meet L'abbé   Raynal ,   who   I   knew   at   Paris ,   &   two   french   Countesses who   brought   letters   to   me   from   some   of   ye   Beaux   esprits   there , so   to   them   I   shall   have   an   Opportunity   of   expressing   my   regret at   being   out   of   Town ,   but   there   is   a   spanish   Baron   de Castille ,   &   some   others ,   who   were   also   recommended   to   me ,   who I   fear   will   depart   with   a   bad   opinion   of   my   Hospitality ,   for twenty   to   one   my   english   Porter   in   Hillstreet   could   not   make them   understand ,   when   they   deliverd   their   letters ,   that   I   was in   the   Country .   At   present   my   scheme   is   to   go to   London   for   the   melancholly   pleasure   of   taking   leave   of   My Lord   Primate   &   My   friend   Mrs   Vesey ;   one   is   desirous   to   defer the   separation   from   ones   friends   to   the   least   moment .   The farewell   always   comes   too   soon .   When   these   Friends   leave London ,   I   believe ,   I   shall   set   out   from   Mount   Edgecumbe , having   long   promised   Lady   Edgecumbe   a   visit ,   &   shall   carry Montagu   with   me ,   who   is   school   fellow   of   Mr   Edgecumbe   &   is much   invited .   I   shall   call   at   Bowood   in   my   way   for   a   day   or two .   I   shall   return   again   to   Sandleford   having   perhaps   first made   a   visit   to   Lady   Nuneham ,   which   I   have   also   promised . Mr   &   Mrs   Vesey   arrived   here   yesterday ,   but   alas !   leave me   on   friday .   They   are   going   from   hence   to   Mr   Burkes   at Beconsfield   who   has   kindly   askd   me   to   be   of   the   party ,   but   as I   shall   be   a   good   while   absent   from   Sandleford   I   have   many domestick   matters   to   settle   before   I   depart . I   had   a   most   polite   entertaining letter   the   other   day   from   my   Brother   Robinson   I   wish   we   two honest   farmers   lived   near   together ,   with   brother   love ,   & rural   sincerity ,   I   flatter   myself   we   shd   be   very   happy ,   but in   this   short   life ,   how   short   a   time   does   one   enjoy   the Friends   one   loves !   I   understand   my   Lord   Primate   &   Sr   Wm Robinson   intend   Horton   the   honour   of   a   visit .   I   am   very   happy that   my   eldest   Nephew   is   to   have   the advantage   of   appearing   in   Ireland   under   the   Primates protection .   I   beg   my   love   to   your   Consort   &   my   Neices ,   &   to   my Nephew   if   at   home ,   and   when   you   see   my   Brother   Robinson   I shall   be   obliged   to   you   if   you   will   present   my   most affectionate   respects   to   him . With   great   regard I   am   dear   Madam Yr   Most   affectte   Sister and   Sincere   friend Eliz   Montagu I   beg   my   love   to   the   Recorder   Mrs   Charles   Robinson   &   my Neice .   compts   to   Mrs   C:   Scott 
BC_1777_EMONTAGU_MA_2	Sandleford   ye       Septr Dear   Madam My   Brother   the   Recorder   would   probably   inform   you ,   that   he left   me   in   London   nursing   Montagu   in   the   Measles .   I   went   to London   on   ye     of   july ,   in   order   to   make   my   adieux   to the   Primate   of   Ireland   &   my   Friend   Mrs   Vesey ,   who   were   in the   point   of   leaving   in   England .   Three   days   after I   got   to   Hillstreet   my   little   Man   was   brought   home   in   a   very drooping   condition ,   &   continued   so   for   a   good   while ,   at   last the   measles   appeared ,   &   I   thank   God   were   not   accompanied   with any   dangerous   symptoms ,   but   he   sufferd   a   good   deal ,   &   I believe   his   Aunt   not   less .   The   voice   I   had   been   used   to   hear sing   a   merry   song ,   or   whistle   a   jolly   tune ,   utterd   nothing   but groans .   On   Saturday   fortnight   he   was   so   recoverd   that   I brought   him   with   me   to   Sandleford ,   &   with   riding   on   horseback , jumping   on   the   Hay   Rick playing   at   Trap ,   &   whatever   suited   the   character   of Valetudinarian   or   Boy ,   he   perfectly   recoverd   his   health   & strength ;   but   to   confirm   these   good   things ,   I   was   orderd   by Sr   J:   Pringle   &   Mr   Farquahar   to   send   him   to bathe   in   the   Sea .   I   thought   Deal   not   being   a   publick   place preferable   to   any   bathing   Town   in   that   stile .   Coffee   houses , Balls ,   &   Assemblies   are   not   good   for   boys .   At   Deal   his   Tutor will   keep   him   to   his   studies ,   &   my   Godson   who   was   in   France with   us   is   now   with   Mrs   Carter ,   so   there   he   will   have   a   safe &   proper   playfellow .   Montagu   &   Mr   Gelbank   set   out   on monday ,   he   will   be   at   Deal   on   thursday .   I   orderd   him   to   wait on   the   Recorder   his   Aunt   &   Cousin ,   but   as   we   are   confined   to time   he   must   make   ye   best   of   his   way   to   Deal ,   else   he   should have   paid   his   duty   to   you   &   my   Brother   at   Denton .   I   was order'd   to   have   him   physicked   &   cleard   of   any   remains   of   the Measles   before   I   sent   him   to   bathe .   We are   therefore   obliged   to   encroach   on   ye   holydays   which   I   never love   to   do ,   but   I   hope   Mr   Heath   will   not   blame   us .   He   is orderd   to   bathe   three   weeks .   Montagus   measles   deranged   all   my schemes .   I   could   not   carry   him   to   Mount   Edgecumbe   to   take   his physick ,   regular   exercise ,   & c   &   when   that   affair   was   over ,   the time   for   going   to   school   left   but   bare   three   weeks   for   the bathing . I   propose   to   go   to   Lord   Harcourts   on   friday .   I   have   had repeated   invitations   all   this   Summer ,   &   had   intended   going   in about   three   weeks ,   but   Lady   Nuneham   earnestly intreats   me   to   meet   the   French   Ambassador   &   his   Lady   there this   week ,   which   I   shall   do   with   great   pleasure .   Nuneham   is   a very   fine   place ,   &   the   owners   of   it   are   so   amiable   &   agreable that   one   passes   ones   time   very   pleasantly .   It   sometimes resembles   a   Congress   of   all   the   Ambassadors   in   Europe ,   for Ld   Harcourt   having   been   in   a   publick character   all   the   Ambassadors ,   &   indeed   all   foreigners   of distinction   come   thither .   I   remember   passing   three   days   there once   without   hearing   a   syllable   of   english   spoken ,   had   every one   of   the   company   spoken   his   Mother   Town   it   wd   have resembled   Babel .   Monsieur   &   Madme   de   Noailles   are   most agreable   Persons ,   &   I   wish   we   may   not   have   any   other Foreigners   while   they   stay .   Our   Measles   prevented   my   paying   my respects   to   Mdme   de   Noailles   when   I   was   in   Town ,   as   her little   Son   has   not   had   the   distemper ,   &   he   is   a   Person   of great   importance   being   Heir   apparent   to   the   greatest   House   in France   in   point   of   connexions ,   &   in   rank   &   fortune   equal   to any . The   Primate   &   Sr   William   Robinson   were   much   pleased   with my   Brothers   kind   reception   of   them .   Indeed   I   do   not   know   any one   who   makes   his   House   so   agreable   to   his   Friends .   His   parts &   knowledge   make   him   an   excellent companion ,   &   his   apparent   benevolence   integrity   &   virtues endear   his   talents .   I   am   much   rejoyced   to   find   riding   has   been of   so   much   service   to   my   Neice ,   &   I   flatter   myself   she   will soon   get   an   establish'd   state   of   health .   I   dare   say   Miss   Mary wishes   herself   old   enough   to   be   of   the   riding   party   with   her Brother   &   Sister . I   expect   every   day   to   hear   of   the   arrival   of   our   Friends   at Armagh .   I   was   a   little   uneasy   about   my   Brothers   health   when   he set   out   on   his   journey ,   but   as   the   exercise   did   not   bring   any return   of   his   jaundice ,   I   have   no   doubt   but   change   of   air   will be   of   service   to   him .   I   agree   entirely   with   the   Primate   that your   Reverend   Consort   wd   grace   a   Stall ,   but   he   is   of   so unambitious   a   spirit   I   believe   he   will   not   take   any   pains   to get   into   one .   Dean   of   Canterbury   would   suit   him   very   well .   A Dean   is   not   obliged   to   fast   or   pray ,   nor   has   ye   troublesome care   of   any   Soul   but   his   own .   We   are   now   very   busy   in   the Harvest We   had   a   great   deal   of   Hay   &   fortunately   very   little   of   it   was spoiled .   We   have   a   prodigious   crop   of   Wheat   this   year ,   &   I dare   say   our   Neighbours   have   the   same ,   &   yet   old   Wheat   sold d   a   bushel   last   week ,   &   some   new   wheat   for   s .   I   hope tho   I   am   a   Farmer   the   price   will   soon   fall ,   for   the   poor Labourers   cannot   earn   a   subsistence   for   their   families   when bread   bears   such   a   price .   I   have   about     Reapers   at   work   at present ,   to   take   advantage   of   the   fine   weather .   I   brew'd   seven hogsheads   of   small   beer   for   them ,   &   fear   it   will   not   last   to ye   end   of   harvest .   The   poor   Reapers   &   Haymakers   bring   nothing but   water   into   ye   field ,   which   with   bad   cheese   &   fine   bread   is their   general   fare .   I   think   our   Northern   people   are   much   more notable ,   their   meals   are   more   plentiful   &   less   delicate ,   they eat   coarse   bread   &   drink   a   great   deal   of   milk ,   &   have   often salf   beef .   I   must   not   congratulate   you   on   the   taking Ticonderago   as   I   imagine   all   the   prophecies   in   your   House foretold   it   wd   not   be   taken ,   &   I   observe   in   general   if people   have   predicted   a   misfortune   they   had   rather   it   should happen   than   have   their   prediction   fall   into   discredit I   beg   the   favour   of   you   to   present   my   most   affectionate compliments   to   your   Divine   &   best   love   to   my   Nephew   &   Neices . I   presume   my   Nephew   now   keeps   happy   holydays .   With   very sincere   esteem I   am   Dear   Madam Your   most   affectionate   sister &   Faithfull   Friend   &   Hble   Servt Eliz   Montagu 
BC_1777_EMONTAGU_MA_3	Dear   Madam Always   sensible   of   your   goodness   to   me   I   should   have   wrote to   you   sooner   if   I   could   have   given   you   any   tolerable   account ; in   spite   of   my   care ,   &   Doctor   Fothergills   skill ,   I   have   made but   a   poor   progress   towards   health .   I   sleep   very   little ,   my stomach   is   much   out   of   order ,   but   my   nerves   mend ,   &   I   cannot better   bear   the   noise   of   a   Cannon   now ,   than   I   could   the   report of   a   pistol   when   I   first   returnd   to   Hillstreet .   My   Doctor keeps   me   very   quiet ,   he   will   not   allow   me   to   see   the   Wise ,   the Witty ,   or   the   fashionable   World .   I   have   dined   below   stairs these   four   or   five   days .   The   Doctor   has   to   day   begun   to   try   a new   medicine ,   but   I   have   as   little   faith   in Doctors   of   Physick   as   some   of   my   family have   in   Doctors   of   Divinity .   I   imagine   my   fever   at   Canterbury was   ye   Influenza   which   has   lately   raged   so   much ,   &   it   leaves people   very   weak ,   &   much   affects   the   nerves .   Some   have   lost their   speech   for   a   few   days ,   others   their   hearing .   My Northumberland   Steward   &   his   Brother ,   who   left   London   when   I did ,   were   both   taken   ill   on   ye   road .   I   believe   fatigue   of preparation   for   my   foreign   journey   did   me   some harm   but   I   imagine   my   principal   illness   was   owing   to   ye Contagion   in   the   air .   My   Servants   have   all   been   sick ,   none   of my   family   have   escaped   but   Miss   Gregory   &   Matt .   You   will   see by   the   papers   Lord   Dartmouth   is   retired   to   ye   greater   post   of the   Seals .   Lord   Rochford   to   ye   sweet   anodyne   of   a   weary Minister ,   a   snug   Pension .   Lord   Weymouth   is   Secretary   of   State in   the   room   of   Ld   Rochford ,   Ld   George Germaine   in   the   place   of   Ld   Dartmouth   Ld   Lyttelton   is chief   justice   in   Eyre .   Lord   Chatham   is   very   ill ,   the   Patriots are   rather   in   despair   of   changing   the   Ministry ;   this   may   damp their   ambition ,   but   will   keep   their   Patriotism   in   its   Vigour . There   is   something   so   mortal   to   Patriotism   in   a   place   that   one can   never   wish   those   who   have   assumed   that   character   to sacrifice   it   to   ye   emoluments   of   an employment .   The   Recorder   was   so   kind   as   to   call   on   me yesterday ,   I   am   afraid   he   was   kept   longer   at   Canterbury   but   my obstructing   the   dispatch   of   his   business ;   he   makes   his   House so   comfortable   to   the   Sick ,   &   so   agreable   to   the   well   that   if I   had   not   been   afraid   of   putting   him   to   inconvenience   I   should have   staid   still   longer   with   him .   Lord   Shelburne   made   a   speech the   other   day   in   the   House of   Lords   which   has   met   with   the   highest   &   most   universal applause .   Mr   Burke   is   kept   from   ye   House   of   Commons   by   ye death   of   his   Father   in   Law .   Lady   Mary   Sommerset   has   recoverd her   health   &   her   nuptials   will   soon   be   celebrated .   Hymen   may exult ,   for   the   pair   are   lovely .   Miss   Gregory   often   spends   ye evening   with   Lady   Mary   &   Lady   Betty ,   as   Ld   Granby   is   of   ye party ,   you   may   suppose   Lady   Betty   &   Miss   Gregory   attend   most to   each   other .   The   Duchess   has   got   ye Influenza   but   is   not   very   bad .   Pray   tell   my   Neice   I   have   not forgot   her   Doll ,   but   have   not   been   well   to   accomplish   an affair   of   such   importance   as   dressing   a   Lady .

BC_1778_EMONTAGU_EC_1	Saturday   night My   dearest   Friend Your   last   letter   gave   me   great   additional concern .   While   I   flatter'd   myself   every   day   was   bringing with   it   those   reflections   which   reconcile   one   in   some measure   to   an   inevitable   misfortune   another   affliction was   falling   upon   my   dear   Friend .   If   the   pains   &   care the   Doctor   &   Mrs   Pennington   had   taken   in   the   education of   their   Son   had   been   merely   to   fit   him   for this   World ,   all   their   attentions   had   been   lost ,   but as   their   greatest   care   was   to   make   him   worthy of   a   better ,   their   labour   has   not   been   in   vain . As   this   good   young   Man   had   a   state   of   health   & spirits   too   weak   for   the   enjoyments ,   &   indeed   the bustle   of   human   life ,   consolation   should   arise   the more   that   he   is   removed   from   it   to   a   state   where his   innocence   &   purity   of   heart   will   secure   his felicity ;   here ,   they   might   sometimes   have   endangerd it .   I   feel   a   great   deal   for   my   dear   Godson   who   is   too young   &   inexperienced   to   know   how   little   this   World   is worth   our   attachment ,   &   of   how   little   happiness   they are   deprived   who   quit   it   at   ye   first   stage   of   their   journey . I   saw   many   of   yr   Friends   at   Mrs   Ords   last   night they   all   express d   the   greatest   solicitude   for   you . I   honour   Miss   Sharpe   for   flying   to   you   on   your distress ,   &   I   flatter   myself   she   will   get   you   to   Town very   soon .   I   find   this   year   has   been   remarkably   sickly Dr   Price   tells   me   there   are     more   deaths   in   ye bills   of   mortality   than   last   year .   You   &   I   have   lasted the   bitterness   of   affliction   in   ye   course   of   last   year pray   God   the   next   may   be   more   prosperous . It   would   ill   become   me   to   give   you   lessons   of   piety or   wisdom ,   so   all   I   can   do   is   to   sympathize   in your   affliction .   I   am   anxious   to   hear   how   the   Doctor &   Mrs   Pennington   do .   I   shd   think   the   sooner   they   leave Dunstan   ye   better ,   Mr   &   Mrs   Barboult   call d   on   me yesterday   morning   they   are   to   dine   with   me   to   morrow They   both   look   well   &   happy   &   I   believe   are   contented   with their   situation . One   has   often   occasion   to   reflect   how   many   things far   worse   than   death   ye   frail   state   of   Man   is   liable to .   The   City   is   now   in   great   confusion   on   account   of Sherwood's   affair .   This   unhappy   Man   was   on   ye   jury when   Dodd   was   tried   for   ye   same   offense .   I   think forgery   is   an   epidemical   distemper .   An   Innkeeper at   Reading   has   been   dealing   in   this   species   of   fraud these   two   years .   He   was   in   distress   a   few   years   ago many   people   gave   him   money   his   Wife   wrote   me   a     letter   of   their   distress   &   I   sent   her   L   ye Members   for   Reading   &   others   gave   them   larger   sums &   their   debts   were   compounded .   Imprudence   finds pity   but   guilt   must   be   punishd .   I   am   sorry   for ye   Mans   family   whom   no   human   assistance   can now   save   from   ruin .   My   Nephew   joins   with   me   in every   kind   wish   &   sentiment   to   my   dear   Godson . I   beg   my   affectionte   compts   to   Mrs   Underdown   & Miss   Sharp .   I   am   my   dearest   friend Most   affectly   yrs   E M 
BC_1778_EMONTAGU_EC_2	Sandleford     of   april My   dear   Friend   wishd   to   hear   of my   safe   arrival   at   Sandleford ,   &   to   that   circumstance   I   can add   that   we   had   an   agreable   journey .   The   weather   was not   delightful   enough   to   have   suited   a   party   of   pleasure , but   it   tolerably   well   in   a   case   in   which   it   was   not to   act   the   Capital   part ,   all   the   occasion   required   was , that   it   should   not   be   troublesome .   The   Country   has   not yet   put   on   its   demy   saison   dress ,   nor   wears   the   blooming airs   of   spring ,   but   its   winter   severity   is   softend ,   &   its   sober chearfulness   is   pleasing   to   one   just   escaped   from   the   bustle of   the   World .   Montagu   rose   at   six   so   impatient   he   was to   run   round   his   play   fields   here ,   After   Church   I   sent him   to   ride   round   the   Farm   with   Mr   Woodhouse ,   I   fear that   whatever   good   or   splendid   things   this   World   may hereafter   afford   him ,   he   will   never   enjoy   so   much   happiness as   he   has   done   here   in   his   infancy   riding   on   a   Poney or   working   at in   ye   Hay   Field .   I   expect   a   most   exact   account of   the   state   of   ye   Farm   at   his   return ,   for   he   has   acquired a   knowledge   of   rural   affairs   by   his   attention   to   them   in his   infancy ,   &   interests   himself   mightily   about   them .   I   hope what   has   been   his   early   sport   will   always   be   a   favorite amusement .   The   Wise   folks   say   a   Gentleman   seldom gets   by   farming ,   that   he   does   not   get   money   I   believe , but   he   gets   better   things ,   health ,   innocent   amusement , an   acquaintance   with   an   industrious   set   of   Men   who deserve ,   &   often   want   his   kindness ;   &   a   knowledge   of   human nature   which   should   be   first   studied   in   its   pure   elements . If   you   hear   any   news   concerning   War   of   Peace ,   or of   any   publick   concern   I   know   you   will   have   ye   goodness to   communicate   such   things ,   but   beg   you   wd   not   delay writing   to   me   till   you   have   these   subjects :   to   hear you   &   my   Friends   are   in   health   &   well   amused ,   is ever   most   interesting   to   my   heart . I   am   always   most   affectly yours E Montagu Miss   Gregory   &   my   Nephew are   much   yr   humble   Servants &   join   with   me   in   Love   to my   Godson 
BC_1778_EMONTAGU_EC_3	Sandleford   April     /   My   dear   Friend My   health ,   for   which   you   so   kindly interest   yourself ,   has   not   been   affected   by   the wayward   humours   of   April ,   tho   they   have   rarely been   more   changeful   or   severe .   We   had   a   great fall   of   snow   on   wensday   morning ,   &   at   night   a very   sharp   frost ,   but But   as   Thompsons   Seasons   are   always on   a   shelf   in   my   dressing   room ,   you   know   it   was   in my   power   to   chuse   my   weather ,   &   suit   the   scene to   my   fancy .   As   the   senses   are   not   so   easily   cheated as   the   imagination ,   I   confess   I   threw   a   Caparicon   over my   shoulders ,   &   by   the   combination   of   Wood   &   Coal , made   a   fire   not   unworthy   of   the   Yule ,   which   we celebrate   in   the   North   the   last   six   days   of   ye   Old , &   first   six   days   of   ye   new   year ,   for   should   the   Fire   go out   before   the   proper   period ,   Vesta   wd   certainly burn   your   House   down   before   that   day   twelve   month , as   I   was   assured   by   our   Stewards   Wife ,   tho   the good   Woman   wd   have   terribly   shock d   if   I   had told   she   talk'd   liked   a   Heathen . I   do   not   wonder   that   you   are   dissatisfied   with the   Memoires   of   the   Noailles   if   you   consider them   as   Biographical   writings .   Heaven   knows l'abbé   Millot   is   very   unlike   the   good   Man Plutarch ,   &   had   the   said   abbé   given   you   the   Life of   either   of   ye   Mareschalles   it   wd   have   been piteous   reading ,   but   as   the   volumes   are   chiefly made   up   of   letters   from   very   eminent Persons ,   in   very   extraordinary ,   or   great situations ,   I   own   I   read   them   with   much   pleasure . Millot   is   the   most   impitoyable   abridger   that ever   existed ;   &   it   is   no   less   true   than   strange that   his   brevity   makes   him   tedious   according to   ye   proper   sense   of   ye   word .   In   the   Court of   the   Muses   Clio   shd   indict   him   on   the Coventry   Act .   he   maims   all   limbs   &   defaces   all   features by   his   amputations .   I   think   the   letters   not   only shew   you   a   great   deal   of   character   of   ye   Writers but   of   many   Persons   concernd ,   &   of   the   politicks of   the   french   Cabinet ,   &   the   nonpoliticks   of the   Spanish   Court .   The   number   of   Persons who   lived   on   alms   at   Madrid   astonishes   one . The   ignorance   &   superstition   of   ye   Grandees of   Spain   exceed   all   imagination . I   am   now   busy   in   reading   the   State   papers Ld   Hardwicke   has   lately   given   to   ye   World . as   I   read   with   them   Rapins   account   of   the   periods   in which   the   letters   were   written ,   I   have   hardly advanced   to   half   ye   first   Volume ,   tho   I   have not   bestow d   less   than   six   hours   every   day on   this   business ,   I   can   give   many   hours   to the   House   of   Tudor ,   but   am   not   enough   of a   jacobite   to   do   ye   same   for   ye   Stuarts . I   wish   our   Friend   Plutarch   wd   come   into   ye World   &   write   ye   Lives   of   Henry   ye   ,   ye   , &   Queen   Bess ,   &   if   Tacitus   wd   write   notes upon   these   lives   truly   ye   Work   wd   be   a   very fine   one .   The   Tudors   afford   the   best   subjects   for History   of   any   of   our   Princes ;   &   as   Men   they are   fine   subjects   for   a   Biographer .   The   change wrought   in   our   system   of   Government   by   Henry ye     renders   his   Reign   very   interesting   to every   Englishman ,   the   effects   of   his   establishment , &   the   consequences   of   the   alterations   in   his   time are   now   explain'd   &   ascertained   by   experience , &   Time   gives   his   unerring   verdict ,   so   that   a wise ,   judicious ,   &   well   informed   Man   might make   a   most   excellent   History .   Lord   Bacon says ,   Henrys   Laws   were   deep   not   vulgar   , but   some   have   insinuated   he   made   them in   certain   cases   as   Pitts   &   Traps   on   purpose to   get   Fines   from   those   who   unknowingly might   fall   into   these   captious   institutions   If   such   accusation be   well   founded ,   his   Majesty   ought   rather to   be   esteem'd   a   cunning   than   a   Wise Man ,   for   a   political   system   ought ,   like a   fine   machine ,   to   have   all   its   movements tend   to   one   great   end ,   &   the   Sovereign , for   whose   benefit   it   works ,   in   a   principal degree ,   should   make   it   his   great   endeavour that   it   is   never   impeded .   Should   not   one think   the   Master   of   ye   Great   Loom   at   Derby very   absurd ,   if   he   tempted   school   boys   to break   some   of   its   wheels ,   in   order   to   get from   them   the   apples   &   ginger   bread   in their   pockets ?   However   in   the   main   Henry was   systematical   in   his   conduct ,   &   therefore a   subject   worthy   the   Historian .   As   to   his capricious   Successor ,   he   wd   afford   a   great   deal of   matter   for   a   Biographer .   He   is   a   subject below   wisedom ,   but   happily   constituted   for Witt   &   vivacity ,   &   the   Writer   who   said   witty things   as   often   as   he   did   absurd   &   extravagant ones ,   would   never   tire   his   Reader .   As   to Elizabeth   Happy ,   wd   be   they he   ( if   his   talents were   equal   to   ye   task )   who   should   write her   general   History ,   or   particular   memoirs I   have   sometimes   had   a   thought   of   drawing a   contrast   between   her   &   Catherine   of Medicis ;   on   purpose   to   shew   the   superiority of   Prudence   above   cunning .   Elizabeth preserved   her   Kingdom   in   quiet   tho it   was   divided   into   various   factions . Catherine   raised   factions   to   get   a   little brief   &   precarious   authority .   Let   not   what I   have   dropped   make   you   raise   the Spectre   of   Plutarch   to   frighten   me .   Be afraid   that   as   I   required   a   wise   judicious &   well   inform'd   Man   to   write   the   History of   Henry   ye   ,   I   shall   not   permit   a   silly , injudicious ,   uninform'd   Woman ,   to undertake   that   of   his   Wiser ,   greater ,   and much   more   magnanimous   Granddaughter . So   pray   do   not   yawn   at   ye   apprehension of   my   History   of   Elizabeth .   I   have   only had   such   a   dream   after   supping   upon Litterary   Lambs   wool   when   some   of   you Learned   &   ingenious   Persons   had   flatterd me .   The   moment   I   awoke   I   perceived   my incapacity ,   inability ,   insufficiency   & c . So   I   find   by   your   letter ,   that   the   Busy Demons   of   all   fashions   keep   Holiday   now : So   gracious   &   so   holy   is   the   time   .   I   suppose they   are   all   playing   at   hazard   in   Satans great   Hall ,   I   really   think   none   of   them seem   qualified   for   any   thing   but   games of   chance ;   except   two   or   three   of   my particular   friends .   Pray   tell   me   how Lord   Chatham   does ,   he   can   play   at   skilfull games ,   &   once   gave   check   mat   to   Frances . We   shd   be   glad   now   to   hinder   ye   Vol . These   things   sometimes   make   me   sad ,   but I   divert   my   mind   from   things   that   are not   my   business .   My   Nephew   is   happy become   expression   here ,   at   his   age   every month   is   may .   I   am   delighted   to   see him   so   happy   in   enjoyments   which cannot   hurt   his   mind   or   body .   I   regret the   being   deprived   of   ye   conversation   of my   Friends ,   but   I   have   not   felt   a   moments ennui   .   I   am   now   going   to   take   ye   air on   purpose   to   give   my   eyes   some   rest . I   am   ever   my   dear   &   most   dear   Friend your   truly   affectte &   Faithfull E Montagu My   sweet   young folks   send   their respects . 
BC_1778_EMONTAGU_MA_1	Jany     My   Dear   Madam I   am   ashamed   I   have   so   long   delay'd   returning   thanks   for your   kind   &   friendly   letter ,   but   my   spirits   felt   a   great   damp at   first   returning   to   London ,   where   I   used   to   enjoy   the friendly   converse   of   my   poor   departed   Brother .   Death , disasters ,   &   incidents ,   have   reduced   a   large   fireside   to   a small   circle .   A   few   years   indeed   show   one ,   that   the flattering   hopes   one   entertained   in   the   nursery   of   living   in social   gayety   &   freedom   with   those   nearly   allied   in   blood were   mere   pleasing   delusions ,   if If other   things   do   not   sever   these   natural   connections the   fatal   scissars   cuts   their   thread .   Tho   my   poor   Brother never   had   opportunity   of   amassing great   wealth ,   I   was   in   hopes   he   would   have   left   some thousands   more   behind   him ,   but   the   easiness   &   flexibility   of his   temper ,   &   a   certain   placid   indolence ,   made   him   give   into more   expence   than   was   prudent .   The   World   lays   the   whole   blame on   him   &   is   lend   in   compassionate lamentations   for   his   Widow ;   indeed   her   present   condition   is very   lamentable ,   &   I   pity   her   extreamly ,   but   certainly   she loved   expense   better   than   he   did .   I   imagine   poor   Man !   he thought   her   fine   dress   &   &   appearance   raised   her   in   the   eye of   the   World .   There   is   no   end   of   ye   bad   consequences   of   an improper   marriage .   When   Men   &   Women   make   an   indiscreet   match , they   say   it   is   no   concern   of   any   ones ,   but   when   any   distress is   the   consequence ,   the   Friends   who   were   thought   impertinent if   they   troubled   themselves   about   ye   match ,   are thought   cruel   if   they   take   no   part   of   ye   evil . I   suppose   you   have   heard   that   Duke   Hamilton   is   going   to   be married   to   ye   youngest   Miss   Burrel   Lady Algernoon   Percys   Sister . I   never   remember   the   Town   so   empty   at   this   Season ,   but   it will   be   full   before   the   birthday   Postchaises   &   Coaches   are continually   arriving   Monsieur   de   Iarnac   ,   who   married   an Irish   beauty ,   in   the   mistaken   opinion   that   she   was   also   a Fortune ,   has   been   stockjobbing   here   prodigiously ,   but   if   we should   really   have   a   french   War   he   will   be   bit . A   very   superb   Theater   is   going   to   be   built   in   the Haymarket ,   it   is   to   be   in   price   the   same   as   the   Opera ;   no places   taken ,   &   the   Play   to   begin   at   eight   o'clock ,   which certainly   suits   better   the   present   hour   of   dining .   Once   a week   each   of   the   other   Theaters   on   certain   conditions are   to   lend   their   Actors ,   so   they   will   each   save   the   expence of   a   sixth   part   at   least   of   their   Theatrical   shews ,   the   other five   nights   their   Houses   will   be   ye   fuller .   If   the   London apprentices   of   these   days   are   half   as   bold   as   he   who   killd the   Lion ,   I   think   they   will   assault   our   new   Theater ,   neither its   price ,   hours ,   or   situation   will   suit   them .   The   Town   has been   very   sickly .   Lady   George   Germaine   has   been   dangerously ill   of   the   Measles ,   but   is   better . I   imagine   you   must   have   really   had   a   merry   Christmass   with your   three   young   ones   all   joy   &   jollity .   Montagu   is   in   fine health ,   &   as   to   spirits ,   he   never   wants   them .   He   rides   in ye   Manage   from   eleven   till   twelve ,   &   then   his Tutor   sets   him   on   Pegasus .   The   day   before   yesterday   was   the first   time   he   had   attaind   the   honour   of   riding   between   the Pillars ,   &   he   was   as   proud   of   it   as   Alexander   when   he   had tamed Bucephalus .   He   dances   under   the   care   of   the   celebrated   Mr Valouys   early   every   morning .   These   exercises   make   a   boy more   healthy   as   well   as   more   graceful .   On   tuesday   he   returns to   Harrow   where   his   Master   tells   me   he   does   very   well .   I carried   him   to   day   to   see   Mr   Levers   Museum .   The   collection of   birds   both   as   to   their   variety   &   preservation   exceeds   that in   the   King   of   Frances   collection   of   natural   curiosities ,   but not   being   shewn   me   by   Mr   de   Buffons   &   Monsr   D'Aubenton   I did   not   see   them   with   so   much   pleasure the The   finest   as   well   as   rarest   bird   being   a Wise   &   learned   Man .   Mr   Lever   is   gone   into   ye   Country ,   &   I was   disappointed   at   not   seeing   a   Man   who   wd   exchange   an Acre   of   good   Land   for   an   extraordinary   fungus . If   there   is   any   thing   which   I   can   do   for   you   in   London   be assured   yr   commands   will   give   me   pleasure .   My   best   love attends   my   Neices   &   Nephew .   Miss   Gregory   is   much   yours .   I   am Dr   Madm   yr   most   affectte   &   Sincere   friend   E   Montagu 
BC_1778_EMONTAGU_MA_2	  of   feb Dr   Madam I   have   now   the   pleasure   to   tell   you   that   your   amiable Daughter   is   safe   &   well   in   Hillstreet ,   where   I   propose   to keep   her   till   tuesday .   As   she   has   been   so   long   in   retirement , two   days   of   company   will   not   do   her   any   harm .   I   am   to   have company   tomorrow   evening   &   at   dinner   on   monday ,   on   tuesday evening   I   am   engaged   to   an   assembly ,   so   cd   not   have   her company .   I   am   to   spend   this   evening   at   Harcourt   House   by   an engagement   before   I   knew   of   the   day   of   my   Dear   Neices arrival ;   if   she   has   any   acquaintance   where   she   can   be   amused this   afternoon   my   Coach   shall   carry   her   to   thither . I   am   sure   you   who   have   a   feeling   &   a   generous   heart   will be   pleased   with   Mr   Thomas   Harris   &   Mrs   Harris   behaviour to   Mrs   M   Robinson .   besides   paying   her   all kind   civilities   Mr   Harris   desired   that   when   she   went   to   a new   Habitation   he   might   present   her   with an   hundred   pound   towards   furnishing   it .   Bad   as   the   World   is , &   tho   selfishness   makes   so   great   a   part   of   the   human composition ,   yet   a   social   kind   character   like   my   poor Brothers   makes   its   impression   on   tempers   of   ye   like   kind ,   & indeed   one   has   a   comfort   in   seeing   his   memory   so   much   beloved &   respected .   Mrs   M:   Robinson   has   continually   some   marks   of attention   paid   to   her .   As   hard   hearts   love   to   insult adversity   tender   ones   endeavour   to   console   it .   The   civilities the   poor   Woman   receives   are   paid ,   not   to   her merits ,   but   to   her   distress ,   or   my   Brothers   memory ,   in   either case   they   do   honour   to   human   nature . I   am   very   glad   to   hear   Mrs   Charles   Robinsons   daughters are   both   well   married   in   ye   East   Indies ,   it   must   be   a   great comfort   to   their   Mother .   My   Sisters   going   to   Domeniceti   has been   put   off   by   the   accident   of   her   being   much   burnt   by the   accident   of   her   cap   taking   fire .   Thank   God   the accident   did   not   prove   fatal .   I   am   very   glad   you   thought   she was   at   Chelsea   for   by   that   means   I   enjoy   the   pleasure   of   my Neices   company .   I   believe Miss   Burrel   has   no   reason   to   be   afraid   of   Duke   Hamilton   he might   boyishly   fire   off   a   Gun   but   he   has   ye   character   of   a very   good   humoured   young   Man :   He   has   no   Vices ,   is   handsome ,   & in   all   respects   like   other   people ,   he   does   not   make   any   great eclat ,   but   the   next   best   thing   to   great   &   good   reputation is   to   be   little   spoken   of .   Where   there   are not   talents   for   the   first ,   there   is   prudence   in   ye   latter .   I suppose   you   know   there   was   a   report   of   my   Fathers   death .   My Porter   had   a   very   fatiguing   morning   with   Messages .   I   had promised   to   introduce   the   Dowager   Duchess   of   Beaufort   to   the French   ambassadress   on   wednesday   night   so   tho   ye   weather   was terrible   I   went   out ,   &   such   was   ye   report   of   poor   Papa   that   I was   stared   at   as   a   Ghost   when   I   enterd   ye   room ,   &   ye Servants   below   were   very   busy   questioning   my   footmen .   To   day I   had   a   message   from   Lady   Ann   &   Lady   Betty   French   with   an apology   that   not   having   heard   of   the   melancholly   event   till to   day   they   had   not   sent   their   enquiries .   All   this   while   ye old   Gentleman   is   in   as   good   health   as   he   has   been   for   this Twelvemonth .   My   amiable   Neice   desires   her   duty   pray   give   my love   to   my   Nephew   &   sweet   Mrs   Mary .   I   rejoyce   to   see your   Daughter   in   such   perfect   health .   You   need   not   be   afraid of   her   being   troublesome   good   sense   &   good   nature   ( &   she   has both )   never   are   so . Miss   Gregory   desires   her   compts .   I   thank   God   my   dear little   Man   after   whom   you   so   kindly   enquire   is   in   perfect health ,   &   goes   on   prosperously   in   his   studies .   From   Mr Heath   to   his   dancing   Master   ( from   top   to   toe )   he   gets approbation .   My   dear   Neice   tells   me   you   are   sadly   teized wth   Rheumatism   Why   do   not   you   drink   Buck   Tea every   day ?   My   love   to   ye   Divine . I   am   Dear   Madm yr   most   affectte   Sister &   Sincere   friend E Montagu 
BC_1778_EMONTAGU_MA_3	April   ye   Dear   Madam I   have   the   pleasure   of   assuring   you   My   Neice   was   in   perfect health   on   Sunday .   I   brought   her   home   to   dinner   &   kept   her   with me   till   monday   morning   when   I   returnd   safe   back   to   her   school . I   never   saw   her   look   in   better   health ;   &   she   stoops   much   less than   when   she   went   to   school .   Her   behaviour   is   always   very proper   &   obliging .   I   carried   her   in   the   evening   to   Mrs Walsinghams   where   I   was   engaged ,   as   she   is   my   particular friend ,   I   cd   take   the   liberty   to   do   so ,   tho   in   Town   young Ladies   of   my   Neices   age   are   not   carried   abroad .   I   am   sure   you will   be   desirious   to   hear   a   true   account   of   Lord   Chathams accident   in   ye   House   of   Lords   &   of   his   present   condition   of health . The   news   papers   are   in   but   little   credit   in   general   but their   account   of   that   affair   has   been   very   exact .   His   Lordship had   been   long   confined by   a   fit   of   the   Gout   so   was   debilitated   by   illness   &   want   of exercise ,   the   House   was   crouded   by   numbers   who   went   to   hear him   on   so   critical   a   state   of   affairs .   The   thunder   of   his eloquence   was   abated ,   &   the   lightening   of   his   eyes   was   dimmed to   a   certain   degree   when   he   rose   to   speak ,   but   the   Glory   of his   former   administration   threw   a   mellow   lustre   around   him ,   & his   experience   of   publick   affairs   gave   the   forces   of   an   Oracle to   what   he   said ,   &   a   reverential   silence   reignd   through   the Senate .   He   spoke   in   answer   to   ye   D:   of   Richmond   the   D:   of Richmond   replied ,   then   his   Lordship   rose   up   to   speak   again   the genius   &   spirit   of   Brittain   seem'd   to   heave   in   his   bosom ,   &   he sunk   down   speechless ,   he   continued   half   an   hour   in   a   fit ,   his eldest   &   second   &   Lord   Mahon   were   in   great   agony   waiting   the doubtfull   event   at   last   he   happily   recoverd   &   tho   he   is   very weak   still   I   am   afraid   by   his   family   that   he   looks   better   than he   did   before   this   accident .   The   next   day   Ld   Shelburne   &   the D:   of   Richmond   carried   in   ye   same   debate &   Lord   Shelburnes   speech   was   much   admired . It   is   said   my   Friend   Mr   Pulteney   has   been   now   at   Paris negotiating   with   Dr   Franklin   but   the   result   is   not   known . Mrs   Pulteney   was   here   last   night   but   I   was   too   discreet   even to   mention   ye   affair .   Montagu   came   home   to   day   The   school   in   a manner   broke   up   yesterday   but   as   ye   weather   is   hot ,   ye   Town sickly ,   &   I   was   to   have   an   assembly   I   wd   not   bring   him   home . He   goes   to   Sandleford   on   tuesday   &   I   am   to   follow   him   on wednesday .   The   weather   is   inviting ,   &   I   hate   this   Season   of ye   year   in   London ,   if   I   am   here   I   am   obliged   often   to   have company ,   &   my   eating   room   is   not   large   enough   &   high   enough for   large   dinners   &   numerous   Guests .   I   shall   come   to   London again   in   my   way   to   Northumberland .   Dr   Robertson   who   calld   on me   this   morning   told   me   a   Gentleman   he   met   in   Berkely   Square just   before   assured   him   the   french   had   taken two   of   our   armed   ships ,   the   Doctor   is   an   Historian   of   great veracity   but   in   an   affair   of   this   kind   he could   not   examine   the   evidence . Mrs   Scott   &   Miss   Arnold   were   here   last   night .   I   was   glad to   see   Miss   A:   appear   in   better   spirits   than   she   has   done   of late .   There   is   no   doubt   but   my   Sister   will   take   care   of   her . She   is   a   very   good   young   Woman   but   she   has   not   only   her   merits to   plead   for   her ,   but   it   wd   be   a   wanton   act   of   cruelty   to take   a   Person   out   of   their   situation   &   then   leave   them unprovided   for ,   &   of   such   cruelty   my   Sister could   never   be   guilty .   I   met   my   Father   taking   the   air yesterday ,   this   fine   weather   agrees   with   him   as   well   as   with the   tender   vegetables .   He   seems   in   good   health   but   his   memory decays   daily .   You   know   that   Mrs   Robinson   has   sold   her   House but   the   money   is   not   yet   paid   in .   Ld   Kerrys   fine   furniture sold   very   dear   these   bad   times .   I   bought   a   large   glass   at   ye french   Ambassadors   sale ,   &   some   other   things   for   my   new   House pretty   cheap .   I   suppose   so   great   a   sale   just   before   made   ye second   sale   more   reasonable .   I   beg   my   love   to   your   Consort   & my   Neice   &   Nephew   &   best   respects   to   my   Bror   Robinson   when you   see   him .   I   believe   ye   Recorder   is   in   London   but   have   not seen   him   of   some   days .   I   hope   you   will   come   into   Berkshire while   I   am   at   Sandleford 
BC_1778_EMONTAGU_MA_4	Tunbridge   Wells   Oct   ye     Dear   Madam If   in   this   Wicked   World   one   was   not   glad   to   enjoy   more pleasures   &   favours   than   one   deserves   I   should   have   felt   more shame   than   joy   at   receiving   your   obliging   letter   yesterday , but   I   will   not   do   myself   the   unmerited   honour   to   say ,   I   was not   perfectly   delighted   with   such   an   instance   of   your   kind attention .   I   got   two   franks   on   purpose   to   write   to   you   from Northumberland ,   &   tho   it   is   a   Country   as   little   famous   perhaps for   the   flowers   of   rhetorick   as   the   flowers   of   the   Pasture , yet   I   flatterd   myself   that   as   soon   as   the   hurry   of   my   business was   over ,   I   should   be   able   to   collect   something   of   news military   or   Civil   that   might   amuse   a   distant   correspondent   but alas !   I   had   been   there   only   ten   days   when   the   epidemical cholick   seized   me ;   it   did   not   stay   with   me   many   hours ,   but left   me   languid   &   enfeebled ,   so   that   I   was   not   able   to   perform more   in   a   day   than   my necessary   business   &   situation   required .   As   I   go   seldom   into Northumberland   I   have   a   great   deal   to   do ,   &   many   people   to   see in   the   short   residence   I   make   there .   I   had   two   returns   of   the disorder   in   my   bowels ;   on   ye   last   attack ,   tho   every   return was   less   severe ,   I   determined   to   try   Tunbridge   waters   as   I believe   them   to   be   great   restoratives ,   however   I   grew   so   much better   ye   first   four   or   five   days   I   was   in London ,   that   I   changed   my   plan ,   &   settled   every   thing   for going   to   Sandleford ,   &   in   this   faith   I   went   to   bed   on   ye friday   night ,   dreaming   that   on   ye   monday   following   I   w d retire   to   the   peaceful   scenes   of   Sandleford ;   but   on   saturday morning   finding   a   little   return   of   ye   disorder ,   I   wrote   to   a Friend   at   Tunbridge ,   to   take   me   ye   House   ye   Duke   of   Leeds   had just   left ,   &   was   therefore   well   air'd   &   on   ye   monday   I transferred   myself   to   Tunbridge .   I   have   not   had   a   moments indisposition   since   I   arrived ,   so   I   presume   the   bile   that   had plagued   me   had   carried   itself   off .   I   am   sure   ye   waters   do   not disagree   with   me ,   for   I   am   very   well ,   &   hope   they   will   conform my   health .   The   last   time   I   drank   them ,   which   is   three   years ago   they   did   me   harm   &   I   was   never without   a   fever   the   whole   six   weeks .   I   find   the   epidemical cholick   has   been   as   severe   on   ye   Water   drinkers   here   as on   other   people   so   I   rather   believe   I   was   lucky   in not   coming   hither   till   it   had   left   me .   I   am   so   little   subject to   disorders   in   ye   bowels   I   was   the   more   alarm'd ,   least   my Constitution   always   bad   enough   should   acquire   a   new   defect .   I propose   to   stay   here   as   long   as   the   weather   is   at   all favourable   to   drinking   ye   Waters ,   for   I   imagine   they   will   not heal   me   after   the   preparation   Nature   gave   for   them ,   &   ye punishment   I   suffer   in   being   here   grows   lighter   by   habit .   I love   London   extreamly ,   where   one   has   choice   of   Society ,   but   I hate   ye   higgledy   piggledy   of   ye   Watering   places .   One   never sees   an   Owl   in   a   flock   of   wild   geese ,   not   a   pigeon   in   ye   same company   as   Hawks   &   Kites .   I   leave   it   to   the   Naturalists   to determine   on   ye   merit   of   each   species   of   fowl ;   all   I   assert is ,   that   nature   has   designed   Birds   of   a   feather ,   shd   flock together , in   the   menagerie   of   ye   Pantiles   there   is   not   so   just   an assortment .   However   I   have   been   fortunate   now   in   finding   Lady Spencer ,   Lady   Clermont ,   Mrs   Broughton ,   Mr   &   Mrs Wedderburne ,   &   many   of   my   voluntary   London   Society   here .   There was   a   pretty   good   Ball   last   tuesday ,   &   Lady   Spencer   &   the Duchess   of   Devonshire   were   so   good   to   Chaperone Miss   Gregory ,   so   I   did   not   think   it   necessary   for   me   to   sit   & see   ye   Graces   of   Messrs   L'epy   Valfrou   & Mlle   Heinel   exhibited   by   the   Misses .   I   understand   there   are not   above   three   dancing   men ,   &   ye   Master   of   ye   ceremonies makes   one   of   ye   numbers .   Minouet   dancing   is   just now   out   of   fashion ,   &   by   ye   Military   air   &   dress   of   many   of   ye Ladies   I   shd   not   be   surprized   if   backsword   &   cudgell   playing should   take   place   of   it .   I   think   our   Encampments   excellent   for making   our   Men   less   effeminate ,   but   if   they   make   our   Women more   masculine   the   male   &   female   characters   which   should   ever be   kept   distinct   will   not   be   more   so   than   they   have   been . I   am   glad   my   Nephew   has   quite   recoverd   his   fall   &   jaundice ;   as ye   first   was   an   accident ,   &   ye   second   perhaps   owing   to   ye remarkable   heat   of   the   summer ,   one   has   good   reason   to   hope   the like   may   not   befal   him   again . We   have   still   fine   weather   here ,   &   I   agree   with   you ,   that ye   dust   &   little   inconveniences   that   attend   a   dry   Season   are not   to   be   put   in   any   account .   I   wd   bear   months   of   dust   for one   fine   day .   I   beg   of   you   to   assure   your   Consort ,   that   I   have a   very   agreable   &   grateful   remembrance   of   ye   kind   visit   he made   me   at   Sandleford ,   &   hope   that   you   &   he ,   &   the   dear   little ones ,   will   do   me   the   like   favour   next   Summer ,   &   pray   tell   my Nephew ,   as   he   loves   a   Poney ,   I   have   a   choice   of   ponies ,   one   of them   is   hardly   so   large   as   ye   Recorders   Dog . I   thought   my   Brother   Robinson   lookd   well   when   he   was   in Town ,   I   am   glad   he   continues   so Next   week   will   carry   off   a   great   part   of   our   Company   but   I flatter   my   self   it   will   bring   Mr   &   Mrs   Thrale   who   are   very amiable   &   agreable .   I   have   not   said   any   thing   yet   to   you   of   my poor   Father ,   the   subject   is   a   very   melancholly   one   at   present . All   one   can   hope   for   him   is   an   easy   exit .   The   great   decay   of his   mental   powers   has   for   some   time   renderd   him   an   object   of great   pity ,   yet   to   my   unspeakable   indignation   I   was   told   by   a Gentleman   here ,   that   one   of   ye   Whist   party   at   ye   Coffee   house some   months   ago   had   not   only   refused   to   pay   a   debt   of eighteens   guineas   which   he   owed   my   Father , but   had   triumphd   over   him   in   a   shocking   manner   asserting   his loss   of   memory   &   imbecillity .   What   a   Wretch   must   it   be   that cd   insult   an   Old   man !   Extream   old   age   is   little   to   be coveted ,   in   long   life   one   must   outlive   ones friends ,   &   perhaps   oneself .   I   imagine   by   the   accounts   of   today I   should   suppose   the   great   deliverer   from human   woes   has   before   this   time   given   him   his   release   My Porter   calls   every   night   just   before   ye   last   letter   bell   to let   me   know   how   he   does .   I   rejoyce   to   hear   Mrs   Best   is   so well ,   perhaps   I   am   the   more   interested   in   it   as   it   is   a   little alarming   to   find   the   play   fellows   of   ones   youth   dropping   off in   a   kind   of   autumnal   decay .   It   is   much   ye   fashion   to   go   from hence   to   visit   the   Camp   at   Coxheath   &   I   intended   going   on purpose   to   shew   Miss   Gregory   an   encampment   which   she   has   never had   an   opportunity   of   seeing   but   she   has   lately   received   an invitation   to   a   Friend   of   hers   who   is   new   in   that   Neighborhood to   pass   a   day   or   two   with   her ,   so   I   hope   we   shall   get   such information   of   their   Majesties   motions   that   she   may   see Coxheath   while   they   are   there .   My   Fathers   illness   wd   make   it impossible   for   me   to   go ,   &   I   had   much   rather   have   the   honour of   seeing   their Majesties   at   St   James ,   &   of   all   Fields   the   Field   of   Man   is that   I   like   least .   The   Fields   which   sustain   Mankind   are pleasant   objects ,   there   in   which   they   are   destroy'd   suggest melancholly   ideas .   The   fine   condition   in   which   I   found   my estates   in   Yorkshire   &   Northumberland ,   &   ye   universal prosperity   there   made   me   wish   we   might   enjoy   our   plenty   in peace ,   run   no   new   hazards ,   &   incur   no   new   taxes .   The   labouring people   in   the   North   do   not   suffer   the   poverty   we   see   in   the same   rank   in   ye   South ,   &   our   parish   rates   are   very   low .   It   was a   great   mortification   to   me   that   my   health   urged   me   to   leave Denton   so   soon ,   but   it   was   impossible   to   stay   longer   without losing   ye   Tunbridge   Season .   I   had   ye   pleasure   of   receiving visits   from   some   of   my   scotch   friends .   Part   of   Miss   Gregory were   so   good   as   to   come   to   me .   &   Lord   Kaimes ,   &   Mrs   Drummond his   Wife ,   came   from Edinburgh   which   is   an     miles   from   Denton   on   purpose   to spend   a   few   days   with   me   His   Lordship   is   a prodigy ,   at     he   is   as   gay   &   as   nimble   as   he   was   at   ,   his sight ,   hearing ,   &   memory   perfect .   He   has   a   great   deal   of knowledge   &   a   lively   imagination ,   &   is   a   most   entertaining companion .   I   have   promised   to   return   his   visit   two   years   hence I   think   as   he   has   not   grown   old   in   space   of     years   two   years more   cannot   have   much   effect ,   if   it   shd   abate   a   little   of his   vivacity   he   wd   still   have   enough   left .   I   beg   my   most affectionate   compts   to   Your   Consort   &   little   family   &   also to   the   Recorder   &   his   family ,   &   my   love   to   dear   Miss   Arnold . She   is   very   happy   in   being   with   you ,   &   I   can   easily   believe you   are   so   in   having   her   She   has   good   sense good   humour   &   discretion   which   are   excellent   qualities   in   a Friend . I   must   again   repeat   my   thanks   for   ye   agreable   favour   of your   letter .   Miss   Gregory   desires   her   best   compts .   I   am   Dr Madam   ye   most   affectte   Sister   &   Sincere   friend   &   Hble Servt   E M 
BC_1778_EMONTAGU_MB_1	Denton   Aug   ye   Dear   Madam I   should   have   had   the   honour   &   pleasure of   writing   to   your   Grace   long   before   this   time ,   but   at   my first   arrival   here   I   was   much   engaged   in   business ,   & then   I   fell   ill ,   &   tho   my   indisposition   abated ,   I   was   afraid of   bringing   back   the   complaint   in   my   stomach   by   stooping to   write .   Last   nights   post   brought   me   the   invaluable   favour of   your   Graces   letter .   I   cannot   express   how   happy   I   was made   by   such   a   proof   of   your   goodness   to   me ,   &   so   favorable an   account   of   your   health ;   may   they   both   continue for   the   Worlds   happiness   &   mine ! As   I   love   &   esteem   Mr   Smelt ,   in   the   highest   degree ,   I rejoyce   that   he   has   had   an   opportunity   of   being   introduced to   your   Grace ,   &   I   shall   be   very   happy   to   be   the   means of   cultivating   an   acquaintance   which   I   really   think will   be   a   delight   to   you   both ,   &   an   honour   to   him .   You will   find   in   him ,   the   talents   you   love ,   &   the   virtues   you respect .   He   is   indeed   a   very   uncommon   Man ,   but   his   Fate is   more   uncommon   than   he .   He   has   recommended   himself at   Court   by   his   integrity   &   sincerity ;   &   to   do   justice ,   it   is still   more   rare   to   find   a   King   &   Queen   who   love   such   virtues , than   a   Courtier   who   practises   them .   May   their   Majesties find   in   their   Servants   &   subjects   the   fidelity   they   so   well deserve .   When   the   King   sent   for   Mr   Smelt   to   Windsor , his   Majesty   graciously   assured   him ,   he   should   always have   an   apartment   near   him   wherever   he   was .   As   I   did not   know   of   this   intention ,   I   had   begged   Mr   &   Mrs   Smelt to   promise   me   they   wd   accept   of   an   apartment   in   my new   House ,   as   soon   as   I   inhabited   it ,   at   such   times   as he   would   like   to   spend   a   few   months   with   their   Friends in   London .   I   was   a   little   hurt   that   I   could   not   get   an   absolute promise   from   them ,   that   they   would   do   so ;   little   did   I suspect ,   that   I ,   a   little   Widow   Gentlewoman   had   the King   of   Great   Brittain   France   &   Ireland   for   a   competitor in   this   matter .   Mr   Smelt   had   just   finishd   a   very   pretty elegant   chearful   House ,   in   a   most   beautiful   situation on   the   River   Swale ,   which   he   was   to   inhabit   the   week after   I   dined   with   him   in   my   way   to   Denton .   The   Banks of   the   Ilyssus   could   not   offer   a   fitter   or   a   fairer   scene   for Philosophick   contemplation .   The   House   commanded   the view   of   a   rich   Valley ,   of   which   the   River   Swale   seemd   so enamoured ,   that   she   prolonged   her   course   by   deviations   in every   possible   direction ,   but   in   so   gentle   a   mode ,   no   part of   it   could   be   calld   crooked ,   tho   she   never   persued   a straight   line ;   sometimes   she   seem d   to   intend   to   leave the   Valley ,   then   again ,   as   if   loth   to   quit   the   peaceful rural   Scene ,   to   proceed   where   navigation   burthen d   her with   Vessels   of   trade   &   business ,   or   fall   into   the   turbulent Ocean ,   she   directed   her   way   to   the   right   or   left ,   taught   her stream   to   glide   softly   &   slow ,   gently   murmuring   her   farewell . distant   Villages ,   the   retreats   of   innocence   &   peace ,   decent Churches ,   built   by   the   Piety ,   not   Pride   of   the   Founders , &   Woods ,   large   enough   to   give   dignity   &   solemnity   to   compleat the   scene ,   are   distinctly   beheld ;   &   distant   Mountains   seem as   Natures   fortresses   to   defend   all   these   gentle   beauties from   violation .   There   is   something   peculiarly   delightful to   the   mind ,   in   the   contemplation   of   places   where Nature   plays   her   virgin   fancies .   Labour ,   &   art ,   &   the   contrivances of   Men ,   being   out   of   the   question ,   the   thought   rises   without impediment   to   the   great   &   bountiful   Creator .   Your   Grace may   imagine ,   that   we   prolonged   our   visit   to   such   Persons ,   in such   a   place ,   as   long   as   the   day   would   permit .   The   polite   and accomplish'd   Mr   Smelt ,   in   this   charming   rural   situation , put   me   in   mind   of   Sr   Callidore   wooing   Pastorella   in the   Legend   of   Courtesy .   Tho   the   Valley   might   be   worthy   of him   I   grieved   to   think   how   many   of   his   qualities would   be   little   understood   by   his   Neighbours ,   &   that   it would   be   long   before   they   became   perfectly   sensible   of his   uncommon   perfections .   I   imagined   him   forever   excluded from   polite   society ,   &   doom'd   like   the   rose   of   the   Wilderness to   waste   his   sweetness   to   ye   Desart   air .   Point   de   Salut pour   les   honnêtes   gens   hors   du   Capitale   is   a   sentiment I   perfectly   subscribe   to .   I   do   not   mean   that   it   is   necessary , or   indeed   either   pleasant ,   or   proper ,   to   live   always   in   a   Croud , or   even   in   the   most   ingenious   &   polite   circles .   Days   of retirement ,   recess   &   solitude ,   are   necessary ,   but   to   be   ever confined   to   the   narrow   sphere   of   a   Country   Neighbourhood is   terrible .   I   am   convinced   that   however   Orpheus   play d when   he   first   went   into   the   Woods ,   he   wd   in   time   catch un   mauvais   ton   from   his   audience . I   do   not   wonder   that   your   Grace   was   so   delighted   with the   Royal   family ,   Royalty ,   out   of   the   question ,   it   is   surely the   finest   family   in   the   World .   I   am   glad   Princess   Mary did   not   escape   your   particular   attention ,   she   answers my   idea   of   the   fairy   queen ,   there   is   a   dignity   in   her little   Person   that   is   surprizing . As   Your   Grace   is   so   good   as   to   tell   me   you   are   now   in a   place   of   leisure   &   solitude ,   where   letters   will   not   be unacceptable ,   I   shall   take   the   liberty   to   trouble   you often .   it   is   very   lucky   however   for   your   Grace ,   that I   am   interrupted   by   a   Visitor ,   &   cannot   further   abuse your   permission   by   this   post . Miss   Gregory   presents   her   best   respects   &   I   beg   mine   to Mrs   Delany .   With   the   most   perfect   esteem   &   tender attachment I   am   Madam your   Graces most   obliged   &   Most   Obedt Hble   Servant Eliz   Montagu 
BC_1778_EMONTAGU_MB_2	Tunbridge   Wells Oct   ye     Dear   Madam Your   Graces   great   sensibility   for   all   who have   the   honour   &   happiness   to   possess   any   share   of   your regard   makes   me   apprehend   you   will   not   be   sorry   to   hear my   health   has   not   suffer d   from   a   late   melancholly   event in   my   family .   The   gradual   slow   approaches   of   this   event took   away   all   surprize ,   &   old   age   had   brought   with   it   so many   infirmities   as   renderd   life   no   longer   a   blessing to   my   poor   Father .   I   thank   God   his   last   illness   was   not attended   with   any   violent   pain   or   disorder ,   &   he   went   off at   last   witht   a   groan   or   sigh . I   hope   your   Grace   received   a   long   letter   of   thanks   for   that you   had   the   goodness   to   write   to   me   while   I   was   in   the North .   I   had   flatterd   myself   I   should   have   often   had   the honour   of   writing   to   you   from   the   North   Pole ,   but   I   was taken   ill   again   immediately ,   &   continued   much   indisposed till   I   came   hither   on   ye     of   Sept:   Whether   my   constitution was   tired   &   ashamed   of   being   perverse ,   or   the   air   here   was of   service   I   do   not   know ,   but   I   found   an   immediate amendment .   I   propose   to   stay   here   till   cold   winds   blow , or   great   rains   wash   us   away .   All   the   habitations   at   Tunbridge are   properly   speaking   Summer   Houses ,   so   after   Winter   storms begin   they   are   not   tenable .   I   hope   however   to   be   able   to persue   the   waters   a   fortnight   longer .   Lady   Spencer ,   Duchess of   Devonshire ,   &   Lady   Clermont   will   leave   us   on   monday . We   shall   then   be   reduced   to   a   little   Country   Neighbourhood . I   hope   your   Grace   found   all   the   benefit   you   wished , nay   more ,   all   that   your   Friends   wish d ,   from   the   air at   Weymouth .   I   was   very   sorry   to   hear   Mrs   Delany had   been   indisposed   in   Town   before   I   arrived   there .   I   rejoyced to   hear   she   was   got   pretty   well   &   gone   to   Bullstrode , where   if   happiness   gives   health   every   one   must   be very   well . I   begin   to   be   very   impatient   to   hear   of   Mrs   Veseys   arrival in   England ,   if   Mr   Vesey   does   not   keep   his   promise   in that   matter   I   shall   fit   out   a   Privateer ,   order   ye   Crow   to make   a   descent   on   ye   Court ,   &   snatch   Mrs   Vesey   as   she is   indulging   a   reverie   in   the   Walks   of   Lucan .   I   do   not think   she   would   dislike   an   adventure   merely   as   an   adventure &   its   ending   in   setting   her   down   at   her   House   in   London would   be   no   disagreable   Circumstance . At   Grantham   I   met   Lady   Henrietta   Roper   &   Mr   Drummond on   their   way   to   Brodsworth .   I   was   much   grieved   to see   Mr   Drummond   so   thin   &   pale .   I   have   great   apprehensions he   will   never   recover   any   good   state ,   of   health . A   most   stupifying   headach   makes   me   unable   to   add more   than   my   most   affectionate   respects   to   Mrs   Delany &   that   I   am   with   the   most   perfect   esteem Dear   Madam Your   Graces   most   Obliged and   devoted E Montagu Miss   Gregory   begs   leave to   present   her   best   respects 
BC_177x_EMONTAGU_RB	Hillstreet   tuesday   ye   Dear   Sir It   was   impossible   to   make   any   of   the   party   who   dined   together   here   on   Sunday   believe   you   ever   were   subject   to   any   pains   but   the   pleasing   pains   of   love .   Our   imaginations   ever   represented   you ,   as   knitt   with   ye   graces   &   ye   loves   in   dance   &   how   could   we   credit   your   grunting ,   &   limping ,   with   the   Rheumatism ,   Bid   the   foul   Fiend   avaunt   !   cherish   her   not   with   ,   nor   indulge   her   with   cushion   or   pillow !   What   have   you   to   do   with   aches   &   cramps ,   &   the   ugly   monsters   that   march   in   the   train   of   old   age ?   Hence   loath'd   Rheumatism , &   Come   the   Goddess   fair   &   free In   Heaven   y'cless'd   Eufrosyne   . Bring   her   to   dine   here   with   you   on   thursday   next ,   &   you   shall   meet   your   Cousin   Mrs   Hord   who is   a   fit   companion   for   the   blythe   Goddess ,   being   very   happy   in   having   a   good   Husband ,   &   your   Cousin   Mrs   Fitzmaurice ,   who   is   in   ye   next   degree   of   beatitude ,   that   of   having   no   Husband   at   all .   Gay   Mr   Rust   shall   sing   you   the   jollyest   ode   of   Anacreon ,   I   will   smile   with   joy   to   see   you   Miss   Gregory   shall   give   you   ye   dimpled   smile ,   such   as   hangs   on   Hebes   cheek ,   &   my   Nephew   shall     on   the   light   fantastick   toe .   On   the   above   conditions   I   wish   you   a   Merry   Christmass   &   a   happy   new   year ,   &   all   ye   good   wishes   that   are   given   at   this   Season ,   &   even   the   wish   of   higher   prosperity   &   joy   which   every   Man   keeps   for   himself .

BC_1781_EMONTAGU_EC_1	June   My   dear   Friend I   much   doubt   whether   you   had   fixd ye   time   for   staying   at   Deal ,   so   cannot   be   sure   this will   find   you   there .   As   it   will   give   you   a   very Good   account   of   my   health ,   I   know   you   will   give   it a   kind   welcome   any   where .   Some   people   wd   say   there is   a   great   deal   of   vanity   in   this   confidence ,   &   I   confess there   is   vanity   &   there   is   pride   in   it   this   confidence   but there   are   better ,   sweeter ,   nobler   engredients   in   it . It   is   not   only   a   cordial   but   almost   a   panacea ,   enlivening in   health   &   healing   in   sickness .   I   have   been   very   fortunate in   getting   such   a   lodging   that   I   can   pass   many   hours without   remembering   I   am   in   a   publick   place   or even   in   a   Walled   Town . Mrs   Garrick   &   Miss   Moore   dined   with   me   when Mrs   Garrick   pass d   thro   Bath   in   ye   way   to   London . Poor   Woman   she   burst   into   a   flood   of   tears   at   coming into   this   House   where   she   had   often   enjoy d   the   company of   Mr   Garrick .   Miss   More   kindly   went   with   her as   far   as   Marlbrô .   On   saturday   we   are   to   go   to Bristol   to   spend   ye   day   wth   Miss   More . I   wish   Mrs   Pennington   wd   for   once   be   more   attentive to   her   health   than   to   her   Husband   &   leave   him for   a   while   under   ye   weight   of   domestick   cares   & arrangemts . I   have   been   so   long   hinderd   writing   my   letter   that I   am   afraid   I   shall   be   too   late   for   ye   post   so   will only   say   that   it   is   probable   I   shall   leave   this   place on   monday   ye     july .   My   Dr   says     weeks   at   this time   of   year   may   be   sufficient .   Indeed   ye   waters   have taken   more   effect   on   me   than   ever   &   I   have   not had   a   moments   illness   since   I   began   them . You   will   please   to   direct   to   Sandd . I   am   ever Most   affectly Yrs   E M 
BC_1781_EMONTAGU_EC_2	Dec   My   dear   Friend You   are   more   le   ton   at   Bath   than we   are   in   London .   We   have   not   of   late   given   to   illustrious examples   of   a   contempt   of   ye     &     commandment . I   pity   Dr   Woodcock   more   than   Mr   B.   Conjugal   love may   be   dissolved   in   every   respect ,   paternal   never . Mrs   Chapone   &   Mesdames   Burrows's   dined   with me   yesterday .   Ld   &   Lady   Dastrey   &   Ld   Shelburne   &   I   hope   Mrs Fielding   ( but   have   not   yet   had   an   answer   from   her   to   my card )   are   to   dine   with   me   on   thursday .   It   wd   be   most   inhuman to   ask   any   one   to   breakfast   with   me ,   but   the   workmen leave   off   as   soon   as   daylight   retires :   they   &   I   shall   have holy   days   next   week ;   The   drums   of   my   Ears   will   find   great relief   in   silence .   The   Bishop   of   Durham   &   Miss   Boughton are   I   believe   really   going   to   be   married .   Montagu ,   for   which I   am   thankful   to   God ,   arrived   here   safe   &   well   on   saturday . I   rejoyce   doubly   in   his   health ,   as   it   gives   me   assurance he   has   not   polluted   his   constitution   by   vicious   communications . I   think   you   will   read   with   great   pleasure what   Mr   Bryant   has   written   on   ye   subject   of   Rowleys poems ,   his   investigations   shew   wonderful   sagacity ,   but what   does   him   most   honour   is   ye   generosity   with   which he   has   acted   towards   Chattertons   family   on   whom   he bestows   ye   whole   profit   of   ye   publication .   I   have   not heard   lately   of   or   from   our   dear   Vesey .   I   wrote   to   her   on   my arrival   in   Portman   square :   I   thought   my   letter   wd   receive some   advantage   from   being   dated   from   a   new   habitation , for   our   Sylph   has   a   great   taste   for   ye   novel .   I   am   afraid , as   her   eyes   are   bad ,   she   will   find   ye   long   evenings   tedious in   solitude :   indeed   it   is   difficult   to   say   whether   the   too   great   bustle of   a   Capital   City   or   ye   dead   repose   of   ye   Country is   worst   for   her ;   but   in   the   most   populous   Place   one may   manage   so   as   to   have   hours   of   quiet   retirement of   society   in   the   Country   when   weary   of   oneself one   has   not   any   chance   possibility   I   do   not   hear   any   publick   news .   The   Town   is   rather   growing more   empty   than   filling ,   as   it   is   ye   fashion   to   spend   Xmass holydays   in   the   Country :   the   weather   is   very   mild ,   &   my situation   here ,   &   my   large   windows ,   &   ye   clear   medium   of   ye plate   glass ,   give   me   so   much   sunshine   &   pure   light ,   that I   fancy   we   are   in   ye   month   of   april   rather   than   December Mrs   Boscawens   Son   has   had   a   fever   but   thank   God is   getting   better ,   I   am   sure   you   were   rejoyced   that   Lady Frances   Coningesby   was   so   happily   released   from   her sufferings .   Her   death   was   sudden   &   without   agony . Ld   Malden   inherits   about   L   a   year   from   her .   Mrs Walsingham   is   her   Executrix   &   Residuary   Legatee   &   it is   thought   will   get   about   L .   Ld   Salisbury   is   embellishing Hatfield   in   the   most   noble   &   elegant   manner .   He   has given   out     tickets   for   a   ball   there   in   ye   Xmass week .   I   know   you   will   be   glad   to   hear   my   health   is not   impaired   by   all   ye   fatigues   I   have   undergone . The   Duchess   of   Portland   &   Mrs   Delany   are   come   to Town   in   perfect   health ;   they   arrived   on   friday . I   desire   my   compts   to   Miss   Sharpe ,   &   all   ye   House   of Bowdler .   I   hope   this   mild   weather   will   make   ye   waters highly   beneficial   to   Miss   Sharp .   I   long   for   yr   coming   to London .   Your   conversation   wd   relieve   me   after   ye   impertinent business   of   ye   day .   Miss   Gregory   &   my   Nephew   desire   their best   respects   pray   give   my   love   to   yr   little   Neice . I   am   ever most   affectly yrs E   Montagu 
BC_1782_EMONTAGU_EC	Sept   ye     My   dear   Friend I   am   very   sorry   to   find   that   your   constitution cannot   reconcile   itself   to   bad   weather ,   for   I   despair   of   any Good   weather   before   next   summer .   We   have   had   more   rain in   this   last   fortnight   than   in   ye   same   period   during   the course   of   this   weeping   Summer .   The   Wheat   in   Northd ,   &   ye barley   here   will   be ,   I   fear ,   utterly   spoilt .   there   is   indeed   more hope   of   ye   barley   as   it   is   not   so   easily   damaged .   While the   Farmer   is   sighing   over   his   Corn   in   ye   field ,   the   poor labourers   in   still   more   immediate   distress   are   deploring   at   home   the want   of   that   employment   from   whence   they   expect   their subsistence .   Is   it   not   strange   that   these   calamities   do   not make   the   Princes   of   ye   Earth   desirous   to   procure   for   their subjects   ye   blessings   of   peace ?   I   wd   fain   believe   that   if we   relieve   Gibraltar   the   Spaniards   will   grow   sick   of the   War . Have   you   heard   any   thing   lately   of   ye   Burrows   family ? My   Sister   said   she   heard   a   report   of   the   seconds   sons   being dangerously   ill   about   a   month   ago   .   I   hope   the   fever   did   not prove   fatal ,   &   I   know   not   of   whom   to   enquire   London   being   now empty . Pray   my   dear   friend   have   you   met   with   ye   strangest   book that   ever   appeard   les   confessions   de   Jean   Jaques   ?   I   think a   pure   Virgin ,   like   you ,   will   read   it   with   less   disgust   &   horror than   ye   Matrons   can   do .   I   imagine   you   will   not   understand some   of   Jean   Jaques   strange   relations ,   they   cannot   corrupt yr   mind ,   so   may   be   safely   read ,   but   not   without   disgust had   I   expected   such   stuff   I   shd   not   have   meddled   with ye   book ,   but   as   it   gives   ye   strangest   specimens   of   ye human   mind   that   ever   was   shewn   I   am   glad   I   was   not   prevented   reading   it   the   virtuous   Jean Jaques   is   a   great   Lyar ;   the   delicate   jean   Jaques   ( who cd   not   accept   in   a   present   what   was   offerd   to   him )   was a   thief .   With   all   his   talents   he   had   such   imbecilities he   had   great   difficulty   to   earn   his   livelihood .   He   changed his   religion   when   very   young   on   motives   of   interest . He   lives lived   in   a   criminal   commerce   with   a   Madame de   Warens ,   tho   he   knew   that   she   carry d   on   one   at ye   same   time   with   her   gardener .   He   says   the   happiest moments   of   his   life   were ,   when   he ,   ye   said   Gardener ,   & said   Lady ,   in   fits   of   tenderness ,   embraced   each   other .   Quel trio   d'amitie   !   the   Gardener   died   &   Jean   jacques   went away   for   a   while ,   when   he   returnd ,   he   found   ye   Lady had   an   intrigue   with   a   Friseur   ,   whom   she   had taken   into   her   family ;   however ,   being ,   as   he   often   tells you ,   the   most   chaste ,   virtuous ,   pious ,   tender   hearted ,   & religious   Woman   in   ye   World ,   she   was   incapable   of   any cruelty   to   an   old   friend ,   &   offerd   ye   same   favours   as during   ye   intrigue   with   ye   Gardener ;   but   there   Jean Jacques   shew'd   some   delicacy ,   for   he   declined   ye   offer , telling   her ,   it   wd   degrade   her ;   on   this   she   grew   rather cool ,   for   as   she   was   chastity   itself ,   did   not   grant   her favours   from   any   solicitations   of   constitution ,   nor   had any   gratification   in   her   intercourse   with   ye   Men ,   therefore she   thought   it   a   mere   caprice   in   Jean   Jacques   to   alter his   manner   of   living   with   her ,   for   such   a   bagatelle   in   short   after   a   while he   left   her ,   but   ye   remembrance   of   ye   extream   happiness   he   enjoy d   in ye   years   he   lived   with   her   &   ye   Gardener ,   remains   in his   mind   superior   to   every   thing   he   has   found   in   this World ,   &   ascribes   all   his   virtue   &   piety   to   ye   conversation &   example   of   this   Madme   de   Warens ,   He   concludes   his   confessions very   early ,   what   were   ye   sins   of   his   more   mature   age   he   does not   inform   us .   he   declares   he   sent   his   children   aux   enfans   trouvés &   yet ,   puts   in   a   claim   to   ye   merit   of   a   good   father ,   for   he   says he   shd   have   been   a   very   tender   Parent ,   if   he   had   kept   his children   at   home .   I   know   it   will   be   a   comfort   to   you   to   know that   he   appears   to   have   been   mad   almost   from   his   infancy , after   all   ye   bad   things   he   confesses ,   one   is   glad   to   think   he   is not   rational .   He   supposes   all   ye   present   Generation   to   be   combined against   him ,   &   that   he   has   always   spies   at   his   heels .   I   suppose that   from   Adam   to   ye   infant   born   to   day ,   there   has   not   been   such a   disposition   for   all   that   is   strange   &   different   from   others characters   in   him   is   not   ye   effect   of   extraordinary   incidents &   situations ,   but   arises   entirely   from   himself .   I   believe indeed   his   early   reading   romance   gave   him   an   affectation of   great   sentiments .   Many   a   Girl   by   reading   ye   loves   of Mandane   for   ye   great   Cyrus ,   or   some   Princess   for   Alexander ye   Great ,   has   been   so   infected   with   ye   passion ,   as   to   marry a   paltry   scoundrel ,   thinking   she   was   acting   like   ye   enamourd princess ,   so   our   Jean   Jaques   fancies   he   is   acting   according to   ye   dictates   of   romantick   magnanimity ,   which   he is   telling   a   paltry   lye   or   committing   petty   larceny . His   imagination   is   all   that   is   delicate   &   high   about   him , &   he   derives   his   satisfaction   in   himself   from   his   sentiments not   from   his   actions . My   poor   Sister   cannot   get   ye   better   of   her   grief   for   ye   loss of   her   worthy   friend   Mrs   Cutts :   these   separations   are   ye most   grievous   things   in   human   life .   A   journey   would   appear melancholly ,   tho   it   lay   through   ye   finest   Country   if   one lost   the   fellow   travellers   with   whom   one   set   out ,   but   such   is the   condition   of   our   pilgrimage ,   it   wd   not   be   insupportable were   it   not   for   the   hope   of   meeting   them   again   in   a   better   World . Mr   &   Mrs   Hingham   could   not   come   with   Mrs   Scott   here   because they   are   engaged   just   now   in   changing   their   habitation . Mr   William   Gregory   is   to   come   to   Sandleford to   day ,   this   day   sennight   my   dear   Gregory   is   to   set   out   with him   for   Scotland ,   to   make   a   visit   of     or     months   to   her Friends .   I   think   it   right   &   proper ,   &   indeed   her   duty   to   do   so , but   I   shall   miss   her   terribly .   She   is   the   most   amiable ,   worthy sensible ,   young   Creature ,   I   ever   knew :   ever   chearful ,   never   too gay ;   always   guided   by   principles ;   very   affectionate ;   very complacent   on   her   manners ,   &   disposition   &   in   short   is   just what   a   Friend   &   a   Parent   could   wish .   I   am   a   little   uneasy about   her   taking   a   journey   now   the   waters   must be   every   where   swell'd   into   floods   but   as   her Brothers   new   married   wife   seems   to   be   in a   dying   way ,   it   is   very   right   that   she   should   be at   hand   to   comfort   him . My   best   respects   attend   yr   family ,   &   Mrs   Underdown . Mrs   Scott   &   Miss   Gregory   hope   you   will   accept   of   theirs I   am   with   most   tender   &   faithfull   attachment Your   most   affectte &   sincere   friend &   obliged   Hble   Servant Eliz   Montagu 
BC_1782_EMONTAGU_SS	P S I   had   not   time   to   send   off   my   packets   yesterday beg   ye   favour   of   you   to   send   ye   enclosed   letters to   ye   Post   when   you   send   yr   own .   Mrs   Veseys   House maid   writes   that   Ld   Howe   is   gone   to   take   ye Command   of   our   Fleet ,   but   I   presume   tho   from   so Great   authority   ye   report   is   not   true .

BC_1783_EMONTAGU_EC	July     My   dear   Friend I   wd   fain   flatter   my   self   that ye   agitation   of   the   Sea   brings   to   you   much   brisker air ,   &   freshes   breezes ,   than   we   enjoy   here ;   but   still I   am   not   quite   void   of   apprehension   that   the close   hot   weather   may     be   bad   for   your   present state   of   health .   Heat   is   bad   for   bilious   Constitutions , &   your   finding   a   greater   reluctance   to   talking than   usual ,   is   a   symptom   of   languor   which the   present   character   of   the   air   must   encrease . I   intended   answering   your   kind   letter   by   ye first   post ,   but   the   heat   of   ye   weather   made   too indolent   for   any   kind   of   exertion ,   &   as   the   post did   not   go   out   yesterday ,   I   was   thrown   two   days behind .   On   thursday   night   we   had   a   violent storm   of   thunder ,   lightening ,   &   rain ,   a   branch   of a   Tree   very   near   the   House   was   struck   by   the lightening ,   but   thank   God   no   farther   mischief was   done .   On   friday   evening   we   had   a   fine airing   in   our   whiskey ,   which   made   us   some amends   for   ye   heat   of   the   morning .   At   Supper we   had   the   most   beautiful   lightening   unaccompan with   thunder ;   for   an   hour   after   Supper   we   banishd the   Candles   that   we   might   ye   better   enjoy   the august   Spectacle ;   but   at   eleven   o'clock   it   grew most   terribly   sublime   indeed ;   the   thunder became   so   loud   that   ye   whole   House   seemd tumbling   about   our   ears ,   &   the   flashes   of   lightening were   horrible ,   but   this   state   did   not   last   long : with   great   thankfulness   to   Providence   we say saw   it   subside   without   having   made   any   fatal impressions .   Saturday   morning   the   weather   was very   suffocating   &   hot ,   in   the   evening   there   were a   few   claps   of   thunder   but   ye   storm   seemd   to be   at   a   distance My   nephew   went   to   Oxford   last   wednesday   to   make a   visit   to   Mr   Lyttelton   Lord   Westcotes   Son ,   & at   my   desire   brought   him   to   Sandleford .   He   is a   young   Man   of   excellent   character ,   has   a   fine understanding ,   &   most   pleasing   manners .   I   rejoyce that   the   Heir   of   Hagley   promises   to   be   worthy to   enjoy   the   Seat   of   the   Muses   &   the   Virtues . Mr   Lyttelton   &   Montagu   were   schoolfellows at   Harrow ,   &   I   hope   the   friendship   they   began there   will   continue   through   Life .   Mr   Lyttelton has   not   so   strong   a   state   of   health   as   I   cd   wish , but   as   he   is   very   temperate   I   hope   he   grows   stronger . He   seems   to   have   ye   gentleness   &   benevolence of   our   Friend   the   good   Lord   Lyttelton .   He   is to   return   to   Oxford   tomorrow . I   am   very   glad   to   hear   our   dear   Sylph   &   Mr Vesey   are   going   to   Margate .   Dr   Warren   forbids his   taking   a   long   journey   during   ye   hot weather ,   &   I   shd   flatter   myself   that   when   the Summer   is   over   he   will   not   wish   to   go   to   Lucan for   ye   Winter   I   hope   our   dear   Sylph   will   be   able to   come   over   to   Deal   to   visit   you   sometimes . The   Bishop   of   Salisbury   has   given   very   laudable attentions   to   ye   affairs   of   his   Diocese ,   &   has written   to   all   ye   Clergy ,   making   strict   enquiries into   the   manner   in   which   they   perform   their Parochial   duties .   I   am   afraid   my   Brother   William will   not   receive   much   praise   from   his   Lordship .   I hear   my   Brother   &   his   family   are   coming   to   Burfield this   week .   I   cannot   ask   the   honour   of   their   company here ,   for   we   are   so   straiten'd   for   room ,   that   I   am   Obliged to   quarter   two   Servants   in   ye   Neighbourhood   even   to make   room   for   Mr   Lyttelton . It   is   great   pity   that   an   unwillingness   to   talk   shd   befal a   Person   who   is   capable   of   conveying   instruction &   giving   pleasure   by   every   sentence   they   utter .   If   you cd   change   this   niggardliness   of   speech   for   ye   loquacious disposition   of   some   of   the   Gossips   in   yr   Neighborhood , the   Publick   wd   receive   much   advantage   by   that exchange ,   but   in   this   respect   as   well   as   in   another the   Rich   are   Misers ,   &   the   poor   are   prodigal . I   am   very   sorry   for   the   accident   of   Mr   Clayton ,   his death   wd   in   any   manner   have   been   a   great   affliction , to   Lady   Louisa   &   all   his   Friends ,   but   the   shock they   must   have   received   on   this   occasion   must   be   very terrible .   Lady   Louisa   is   an   excellent   Woman   &   Providence will   support   her ,   I   make   no   doubt Pray   make   my   best   compts   to   Mr   Carter   &   Mrs Underdown ,   &   give   my   love   to   my   dear   Godson   if he   is   with   you .   I   hope   you   will   often   take   a   trip to   visit   Mrs   Pennington .   Let   me   intreat   you   to consult   Dr   Douglas   on   ye   affair   of   yr   speech ,   the Organs   must   be   debilitated   if   they   cannot   perform the   easy   days   work   you   impose   on   them .   Weight of   Sense   is   a   meer   metaphorical   expression ,   & a   sentence   of   yours   is   not   heavier   in   ye   tongue than   ye   levities   of   Miss   Beddy   Belair .   Miss   Gregory my   Nephew ,   &   Mr   Gilbank ,   desire   their   respects . We   are   all   in   perfect   health ,   &   our   mode   of   life , as   I   told   you ,   does   not   aim   at   any   other   perfection . With   ye   most   affectionate   respect   &   attachment I   am   my   dear   Friend Ever   yours E Montagu 
BC_1785_EMONTAGU_SS	Sandleford   june   ye     ? My   very   dear   Sister I   should   have   written   to   you   on   monday if   I   had   not   understood   you   intended   leaving   London   on tuesday   morning ,   but   by   a   letter   I   had   ye   pleasure   of receiving   from   you   today ,   I   find   you   did   not   set   out till   wednesday .   I   had   so   little   sleep   in   Portman   Square on   friday   night ,   &   felt   my   self   so   languid   on   friday Saturday   morning that   I   determined   not   to   go   any   farther   than   Salt   Hill that   day ,   &   it   succeeded   well ,   for   I   found   myself   much refresh d   by   a   short   journey ,   a   long   one   wd   have   been above   my   abilities .   I   call d   at   Reading   at   my   Brothers , he   &   all   his   family   except   Miss   Robinson   were   gone to   Church   at   Burfield ,   as   they   carried   some   Lady   with them   thither   so   our   Neices   decided   by   lot   who   shd   stay at   home .   My   Neice   received   me   very   kindly ,   &   she   seems in   good   health ,   &   good   spirits .   Their   House   is   no bigger   than   a   Ladys   hat   box ,   &   I   find   ye   Divine   is much   discontented   with   it .   I   have   known   him   peevish with   less   reason ;   it   seems   a   better   Habitation   cd   not be   got   near   Burfield ,   However ,   as   this   House   gives   a prospect   of   Bath   in   ye   Winter ,   I   believe   ye   Ladies   are not   discontented   with   it . I   was   so   mended   by   my   journey   I   brought   health with   me   to   Sandleford ,   &   I   found   the   place   much   improved . indeed   there   have   been   above     men   at   work   at   it , ever   since   I   left   it ,   &   they   are   still   in   full   employ . My   new   dressing   room   has   still   some   little   smell   of paint ,   but   it   presents   a   most   beautifull   prospect to   ye   eye   all   day ,   &   in   the   evening   it   gives   the finest   chorus   of   nightingales   I   ever   heard .   My   House is   in   a   state   of   chaos ,   you   see   the   elements   of   good things ,   but   as   yet   in   confusion   dire   ,   I   hope   while   I   am in   Northumberland   ye   new   rooms   will   be   floored , &   ye   ceilings   done ,   but   I   cannot   endure   ye   noise of   hammers   &   ye   smell   of   plaister ,   so   they   must wait   for   my   absence . I   flatter   myself   yr   journey   will   have   been   productive of   health ,   &   I   am   sure   the   conclusion   of   it   at   Persefield will   of   much   pleasure .   Amiable   Friends   in   so   lovely a   place ,   with   health ,   &   fine   weather ,   make   up   a sum   of   happiness .   I   never   saw   a   more   delightfull place   than   Persefield ;   its   natural   beauties   set   ye art   of   a   Brown ,   or   ye   expence   of   a   Prince   at   defiance . I   was   so   stupid   as   not   to   enquire   ye   direction   to Persefield ,   but   I   have   desired   Mrs   M:   Montagu   to enquire   at   Mr   Raikes   if   you   have   not   given   his one .   My   letters   will   pass   through   ye   privileged hands   of   one   Nephew   to   you   always . I   suppose   you   have   heard   that   Mrs   Fawkener   has compleated   her   ruin ,   &   her   Familys   affliction .   I   call'd according   to   Mrs   Poyntz   desire   at   Midgeham   to   see the   youngest   Daughter ,   a   most   lovely   beautifull Girl ,   but   I   found   her   so   blasted   by   this   misfortune   I shd   hardly   have   known   her   .   Mrs   Poyntz   was   in   a   bad state   of   health   from   grief   of   Lady   Corkes   death .   I fear   this   will   give   her   the   coup   de   Grace   .   I   hear she   is   continually   in   fitts .   While   this   unfortunate   Mrs F-   was   under   her   Mothers   care   she   was   the picture   of   Virgin   modesty ,   but   the   gayeties   of   the Ladies   of   the   Ton ,   to   many   of   whom   she   had   ye misfortune   to   be   selected ,   have   affected   a   wonderfull change   of   manners   &   from   being   ye   pride   of   her family   she   has   stain'd   a   father's   Couch   wth   tears , &   she   has   dyd   a   mothers   cheek   wth   shame . I   imagine   you   have   heard   she   eloped   from   her   aunts at   St   Albarns   while   ye   family   was   at   prayers .   Their aunt   &   Father   imagined   she   had   drown d   herself , &   ye   Ponds   were   drawn   but   she   was   actuated   by a   mere   desperate   insanity   &   fled   to   her   Lover . I   have   not   visited   my   Neighbor   ye Duchess   of   Athol ,   &   must   not   go   today ,   as   it   is   Market day ,   &   her   Grace   went   to   Newbury   last   week   to buy   a   Cow .   She   sometimes   goes   to   ye   Blacksmiths   & stands   by   while   her   Horses   are   shed .   I   have   an   american who   buys   Oats   at   Market   for   her   Cattle ,   so I   have   not   ye   honour   to   be   ye   most   notable   Woman in   ye   Neighborhood   which   is   rather   mortifying I   desire   my   best   compts   to   Mr   &   Mrs   Smelt   &   love to   dear   Miss   Arnold .   I   had   forgot   to   call   on   poor Miss   Pocklington   before   I   left   London   but I   sent   her   a   letter   with   a   bank   bill   enclosed today   by   a   safe   hand . I   have   had   charming   airings   every   day   in   my Whiskey   which   have   quite   establish d   my   health . I   beg   in   every   letter   you   wd   remember   yr   health as   ye   most   interesting   of   subjects . I   am   ever   your   most   affectte   Sister Sincere   Friend   &   Obliged E   Montagu 
BC_1786_EMONTAGU_SS_1	Jany   ye     My   very   very   dear   Sister Yesterday   morning   brought   me   the   elegant entertainment   of   your   letter ;   the   evening   the   substantial   food for   a   Feast   your   noble   Turkey ;   of   the   first   I   deem'd   as   Duncomb of   ye   Manor   of   Hemsley ,   it   was   too   good   to   give   to   any   one ,   but   of   the latter   many   of   my   Friends   shall   partake .   Our   dear   young Friends   calld   on   me   yesterday   morning   to   invite   me   to dine   with   them ,   &   to   go   to   the   Play ,   for   what   they   had   just procured   a   box ;   a   matter   of   no   small   difficulty   when   Mrs Jordan   is   to   act ,   as   Heraclitus   &   Democritus   had   each   their   different   Parties   of   Witts   &   Philosopher ,   so   have   Mrs   Siddons &   Mrs   Jordan   amongst   the   fine   Gentlemen ,   &   fine   Ladies ,   all   indeed   are agreed   that   it   is   charming   to   laugh ,   or   weep ,   but   some greatly   prefer   the   first   others   ye   latter .   As   I   think Comedy   as   well   constituted   to   purge   ones   mind   of   scorn &   contempt ,   as   Tragedy   of   pity   &   terror ,   I   was   very   desirous to   see   Mrs   Jordan   in   her   facetious   modes ,   &   had   told   my young   folks   I   wd   be   of   their   party ,   or   they   shd   be   of   mine , when   we   cd   get   a   box .   I   made     or     unsuccessfull   attempts during   ye   mild   weather ,   but   I   have   now   determined   not   to put   my   face   out   of   doors   till   ye   frost   is   gone ,   least   Sr   Anthony should   seize   it ,   so   I   excused   myself   as   to   ye   play ,   &   prevailed on   them   to   dine   with   me ,   &   attend   Mrs   Jordan   in   ye   afternoon . Ld   Sandwich   &   all   who   have   much   frequented   ye   Theatre ;   speak of   Mrs   Jordan   as   ye   best   Actress   in   parts   of   humour   that   ever was   seen   on   any   stage .   The   Romp   &   Country   Girl   are   her characters ,   &   I   shd   be   glad   to   see   any   where ,   in   these   our   days , a   Miss   Hoyden   who   has   no   boarding   school   airs   &   grimaces . Our   Young   Gentleman   is   not   gone   to   Bath ,   &   I   hear   does   not intend   going .   He   never   calls   now   on   his   Brother   or   on   me , so   we   learn   this   from   others .   I   am   vex'd   beyond   measure   at   it   as I   know   our   good   &   noble   Friends   kind   intentions   towards him ,   &   to   be   treated   with   any   neglect   at   this   time   might occasion   mortification   to   both   parties ;   but   it   would   only   produce mischief   perhaps   should   one   prevail   on   him   to   do   any   thing contrary   to   his   inclination ,   &   it   is   ever   dangerous   to   give counsel   to   ye   perverse   ,   &   in   vain   to   offer   advise   to   ye   obstinate . I   wish   he   would   apprehend   this   certain   truth ,   that   the Man   who   endeavours   to   please   himself   only ,   leads   an   unpleasant life .   In   social   life   all   must   pay   a   Commutation   tax .   Mr Jerningham   by   illness   was   prevented   going   into   Norfolk . I   did   not   know   any   thing   of   his   indisposition   till   ye   other day .   he   calld   at   my   Gate ,   &   told   my   Porter ,   &   added   he   wd contrive   to   send   your   parcel   to   Lady   Jerningham   who   would convey   it   to   you .   The   Wind   is   now   howling ,   &   ye   snow   driving at   a   terrible   rate ,   I   expect   Sr   Joseph   &   Lady   Bankes ,   a   Monsr de   Saledan Saladin   ,   a   swiss   Gentleman ,   recommended   to   me   by Mr Lockh ,   &   Madme   du   Boccage ,   at   dinner ,   as   also   my Young   folks ,   &   some   other   friends   so   I   can   say . blow ,   blow ,   thou   winters   wind ; but   I   pity   the   Squires   who are   gone   into   ye   Country   for   the   rural   sports ,   &   their Wives ,   who   in   the   Country   can   find   no   sport   at   all . I   beg   of   you   not   to   leave   ye   good   City   of   Norwich   during this   Weather .   A   Walled   Town   is   a   better   defence   against the   cutting   air   than   a   Hedge   when ,   thorough   ye   Hawthorn   blows   ye   cold   wind I   shudder   at   the   thought   of   your   going   into   a   cold   Villa . I   am   told   our   Brother   William   has   taken   a   House   at Reading .   There   is   always   to   be   found   Cards   &   tittle   tattle in   a   Country   Town ,   so   they   will   be   more   amused   there in   Winter   than   at   Denton ;   in   Summer   it   will   be   less   pleasant . I   suppose   they   will   pass   this   whole   Winter   at   Bath . I   desire   my   best   respects   to   Mr   &   Mrs   Freeman   &   love   to dear   Miss   Arnold .   The   Dowager   Duchess   of   Beaufort   has been   extreamly   ill   but   is   quite   recoverd .   The   Goddess   Lucina will   be   in   full   employ   Lady   Salisbury   &   Lady   Fitzwilliams   are both   breeding ,   but   the   Infants   looks   will   be   ye   colour   of   their Husbands   so   they   will   hardly   be   so   fair   as   Master   Bamfields Poor   Vesey   is   ye   shadow   of   a   Ghost ,   or   ye   Ghost   of   a   Shadow ,   &   she is   indeed   in   a   declining   state .   Let   me   again   entreat   beg   beseech   you to   keep   yr   self   close   at   ye   fireside   this   horrible   weather .   We   are   all   in deep   mourning   in   Town .   With   every   good   wish   .   I   am   yr   sincerely   affectteSist &   obliged   E M 
BC_1786_EMONTAGU_SS_2	Feb   ? My   very   dear   Sister I   believe   you   guess d   very   truly ,   that   our Frend   the   Reorder   had   not   made   any   application   to   have the   office   of   a   Master   in   Chancery ;   as   Otium   cum   dignitate I   wish'd   it   for   him ,   &   I   think   he   wd   have   had   a   superiority over   most   of   his   Brethren ,   both   on   account   of   his   talents ,   & long   practise   at   ye   Bar .   I   did   not   know   whether   Mr   Pitts desire   to   have   Morris   in   Parlt   might   not   have   induced   him to   apply   to   ye   Chancellor   on   this   occasion .   I   am   far   from   believing the   young   Man   wd   make   a   great   figure   in   ye   H:   of   Commons , for   with   very   good   parts ,   great   memory ,   &   much   reading ,   he is   remarkably   deficient   in   every   qualification   for   a   Popular   speaker however   it   would   be   best   for   him   to   be   call d   forth   into   the   World before   his   Singularities   have   had   time   to   gather   full   strength . I   suppose   you   may   before   this   time   have   had   fuller   information of   Miss   Barwells   affair   than   I   can   give   you ,   as   I   know   few   persons acquainted   with   ye   family ,   but   I   have ,   since   I   mentiond   it   to   you , been   told ,   the   amorous   pair   were   found   in   a   dirty   Inn   at   or   near Dartford ,   where   they   had   pass d     days ,   &   I   presume   nights   together The   Gallant   most   basely   charged   ye   fair   one   with   having from   ye   first   made   ye   advances ,   &   urged   ye   elopement ;   his   apologies rather   aggravate   than   extenuate   his   quilt ,   for   it   is   easier   for   a Man   to   resist   the   solicitations   of   another   passions   than   his   own I   hear   he   is   a   great   fool ,   &   I   am   sure   he   must   be   a   great   scoundrel he   married   a   great   fortune ,   or   at   least   a   Woman   with   a   fortune superior   to   his   own .   I   find   poor   Miss   Barwell   was   suspected to   have   an   amourous   disposition ,   &   ye   men   now   say ,   they   are not   surprized   at   what   has   happen'd .   She   had   a   little   while   before this   exploit   settled   herself   at   a   Mrs   Gordons ,   who   takes   young Ladies   to   board   with   her .   Some   say   Mr   Barwell ,   when   he   brought her   back ,   put   her   under   ye   care   of   Dr   Monro   in   which   I   think he   did   very   wisely ,   for   bleeding   &   a   low   diet   wd   do   her   good &   a   strait   wastecoat   cd   do   her   no   harm .   I   hear   Mr   Barwells Wife   is   very   pretty ,   but   not   so   beautifull   as   ye   Nymph   who lived   in   his   Park   on   whom   he   is   said   to   have   settled   L   a year   which   indeed   he   may   well   afford ,   if   as   ye   World   says ,   he brought   L   from   India .   Our   Cousin   Botham   regretted   not finding   you   at   Catton ,   he   intends   to   go   this   week   to   see   Adl Derbys   at   Newtown ,   he   may   lett   so   much   of   ye   Land   that his   Rent   will   be   only   L   a   year   for   ye   House .   The   Adl   will keep   ye   Woods   in   his   hands   so   Mr   Botham   will   have   some very   pleasant   walks   in   them   without   expence .   the   Kitchen garden   is   not   large ,   there   is   good   wall   fruit ,   the   Adl   did   not keep   a   Gardener   constantly .   I   shd   have   thought   a   box   nearby   London wd   have   been   more   eligible   for   ye   Young   Man .   I   believe   he   is   not very   rich .   Ld   Maccartney   is   come   home   with   clean   hands . he   abstain d   from   pomp   &   luxury ,   &   saved   all   ye   income   of his   appointments   except   what   was   necessary   to   support   him decently ;   he   refused   all   presents   &   perquisites .   He   has   brought   home good   health   &   good   spirits ,   &   Lady   Maccartney   looks   so   happy   it is   delightfull   to   see   it .   What   contentions   may   arise   between his   Lordship   &   Mr   Hastings   one   cannot   tell .   Some   say   they   both wish   to   return   invested   with   ye   Government   of   Bengal   under new   regulations .   The   Archbishop   of   Yorks   Son   distinguishd   himself by   such   wise   conduct   as   is   very   uncommon   in   a   young   Man , &   so   disinterested   as   is   extraordinary   in   any   Man .   I   have   been   p Sr   Williams   legacy ,   &   have   his   mourning   ring   on   my   finger . I   dare   say   ye   drunken   Porter   carried   your   Turkey   where   ye   Hare was   due ,   &   well   might   those   who   got   ye   fine   bird   say ,   exchange is   no   robbery .   Your   Turkey   was   heartily   eaten ,   &   as   heartily   praised . at   my   table ,   by   a   large   company   of   which   Montagu   &   his   dear little   wife   were   a   part .   I   am   to   dine   with   them   to   day ,   only   our   dear selves .   All   my   acquaintance   have   left   their   names   at   Mrs   Montagus &   as   many   as   have   seen   her   are   charmd   with   her ,   indeed   she is   a   charming   creature ,   &   has   an   ease   &   politeness   of   manner   fit to   make   a   figure   on   ye   great   World   with   all   ye   virtues   for   domestick life ,   &   I   think   I   may   truly   say   Montagu   is   worthy   of   such   a   Wife . I   admire   Monseys   Visit   to   his   Senior   ye   Oak .   By   a   letter   I   received from   my   Ld   Primate     days   ago   I   imagine   he   wd   have   been in   Town   by   this   time   if   his   House   in   Conduct   Street   had   been fit   for   his   reception ,   but   ye   alterations   are   not   compleated . Miss   Frances   Bowdler   dined   with   me   on   monday ,   she   is   pretty   well &   gave   a   good   account   of   her   Mothers   health   the   Doctor   tells   me he   is   very   happy   now   he   has   quelled   his   profession   &   his   Brother is   no   less   pleased   that   he   has   done   the   same .   I   am   going   to   make enquiries   on   a   vulgar   subject .   Pray   is   not   there   a   particular   kind of   Soap   for   cleaning   silk   stockings   or   washing   blonde   &   what name   does   it   go   by .   We   had   a   very   pleasant   dinner   a   few   days ago   at   Mr   Raikes .   Give   my   love   to   dear   Miss   Arnold   &   my respects   to   Mr   Freeman .   The   Recorder   looks   well   he   calld   here   for a   moment . I   am   ever   most   affectly   yrs   E Montagu 
BC_1786_EMONTAGU_SS_3	Denton   Sept   ye   My   very   dear   Sister Your   letters   always   give   me   great   pleasure , yours   which   I   received   this   morning   not   only   had   that   merit , but   likewise   relieved   me   from   pain ,   for   I   began   to   be   anxious to   hear   of   your   health .   I   should   have   written   to   you   from Mr   Smelts ,   but   the   long   journey   had   fatigued   me   tho   I   made   it by   ye   most   gentle   degrees ,   &   tho   not   ill   I   felt   myself   rather unwell ,   &   in   that   situation   I   am   always   afraid   of   writing , as   the   posture   does   not   well   agree   with   me . My   last   letter   wd   inform   you ,   that   Montagu   &   his   Wife arrived   safe   &   well   a   week   after   ye   time   I   had   expected   them . I   am   of   yr   opinion ,   that   if   our   dear   little   Neice   was   pregnant she   will   be   so   again   before   it   is   long ,   but   had   not   Dr   Denham given   it   as   his   opinion   that   she   had   miscarried ,   I   shd   have had   my   doubts   on   ye   subject .   I   thought   it   not   improbable her   jaunts   before   she   left   London   rough   Voyage   to   Dieppe &   ye   cold   breezes   from   ye   Sea   might   occasion   certain   irregularities but   I   believe   from   her   accounts ,   &   Dr   Denhams   authority , that   she   was   breeding ,   &   tho   it   wd   make   me   very   happy to   be   a   Grandmother   immediately ,   yet   I   can   wait   patiently , &   indeed   I   shd   think   myself   very   ungratefull   to   God   for   the many   blessings   he   has   bestow d   on   me ,   if   I   dared   to   repine that   every   wish   was   not   gratified   that   I   might   form ,   The view   of   our   Northern   Domains   might   awaken   in   me   a stronger   desire   of   posterity ,   but   how   often   has   ye   Heir of   great   possessions   squanderd   them   in   ye   most   absurd   &   disgracefull manner .   If   I   could   be   assured   Montagu   wd   have   a Son   like   himself ,   I   should   indeed   be   very   Sollicitous   for ye   arrival   of   ye   Young   Gentleman ;   but   a   Son   who   should prove   like   ye   Sons   of   some   worthy   Men   I   have   known ,   or a   Daughter   like   Strathmore ,   wd   be   a   curse .   The   youth   who   is born   to   a   large   entaild   inheritance   is   born   to   great dangers . Monseys   frisks   to   London   from   Norwich   must   be   a   placed   to the   frolicksome   disposition   of   youth   for   I   found   he   had   not   any determinate   object .   I   believe   he   is   very   troublesome   to   his   grandaughter and   from   a   happy   insensibility   in   his   temper   they   cannot revenge   themselves   by   troubling   him . I   staid   only     Days   at   Mr   Smelts ,   but   tho   the   days   were few   in   number ,   they   were   great   in   value .   The   cordiality of   their   reception ,   their   elegant   hospitality ,   their   charming place ,   make   ye   time   one   spends   with   them   not   only happy   as   it   passes ,   but   it   leaves   a   most   pleasing   remembrance behind   it .   The   House   looks   down   a   beautifull   Valley   much adorn d   by   ye   River   Swale ,   &   enobled   by   y=e   View   of   distant Mountains ,   the   plantations   he   has   made   thrive   &   come forward   in   a   surprizing   manner .     !   years   have   had   as good   effect   on   them   as   you   wd   have   expected   from   . His   House   he   built   on   a   small   scale ,   but   convenient   &   elegant in   the   highest   degree   &   ye   view   of   ye   sweet   Valley   makes every   room   appear   gay .   The   impression   Langton   had   made on   my   mind   was   not   favorable   to   Denton .   The   first   indeed is   the   Dominion   of   Pan   ye   Dryades   &   Naiades ,   ye   second   belongs to   gloomy   Dis   &   Proserpina .   However   it   has   its   merits   tho more   at   a   profitable   than   pleasant   kind . I   found   the P   of   W:   did   not   appear   much   at   Brighthelmston .   Mrs Fitzherbert   was   there   in   a   humble   style   with   few Servants ,   &   a   shabby   old   Carriage ,   &   had   not   any   great attentions   paid   to   her   by   the   company ,   which   indeed was   not   numerous ;   it   is   supposed   that   ye   place   wd have   been   more   frequented   if   people   had   not   wish d to   avoid   an   intimate   Acquaintance   with   ye   Lady or   her   Lover .   Her   Brother   was   with   her ,   it   is   said   she looks   melancholly .   Some   french   Esprit   fort   said   on his   deathbed ,   he   was   going   in   search   of   un   grand peutetre   .   this   Lady   has   ventured   on   a   grand   peutetre   . Miss   Willock   is   certainly   more   mad   than ever . Mrs   Wilkes   wrote   me   an   account   of   their   intentions to   go   to   New   York .   I   heartily   wish   them   success ,   but   it is   so   precarious   I   am   sorry   she   ever   gave   up   an establishment   which   was   a   maintenance ,   I   sent Miss   Wilkes   a   present   of   L ,   in   return   for   which I   had   a   very   obliging   pretty   letter   from   her . just   before   her   setting   out . Our   young   Friends   had   not   a   very   pleasant   journey ,   they travell d   in   their   Phaeton   with     of   their   own   Horses . Her   maid   with   post   Horses   in   their   Vis   à   Vis   .   They   were ten   days   on   ye   road   from   London   to   Mr   Smelts ,   &   days   from   Mr   Smelts   to   Denton .   I   am   happy   to   see   her health   is   not   impaired   by   what   has   happend ,   she is   very   well   &   grown   plumper .   He   thank   God   is   in perfect   health .   We   have   generally   wind windy   weather here ,   but   lately   worse   than   usual ,   for   some   nights have   been   horribly   tempestuous .   The   Earthquake which   has   made   a   figure   in   ye   Newspaper   I find   was   not   felt   here ,   &   not   above     people   in Newcastle   were   sensible   of   it . Our   young   Friends   send   their   duty   to   you .   My best   respects   attend   Mr   &   Mrs   Freeman . I   hope   ye   headaches   have   kept   their   distance . I   am   my   dear   Sister Ever   most   affectly yrs Newcastle   upon   Tyne .   September   the   tenth 
BC_1787_EMONTAGU_EV	Sept   ye     Opportunity   again   courteously   offers to   convey   a   letter   from   me   to   my   dear   Sylph ,   &   I   cannot decline   his   kind   proposal ;   but   he   acts   as   a   much   better Carrier ,   he   never   brings   to   Sandleford   any   thing   to   put   in a   letter   to   make   it   agreable   &   entertaining .   Indeed   for some   days   past   I   have   not   been   in   good   spirits .   Sr   William Robinson   had   been   several   months   in   a   declining state   of   health ,   but   I   flatterd   myself   he   might   last   some time   longer ,   but   last   tuesday   I   had   a   letter   from   Bath to   tell   me   that   on   monday   morning   he   expired .   His   general benevolence   made   him   of   value   to   ye   World ,   but   his   strong attachment   to   his   Friends ,   his   continual   attention   to   serve &   oblige   them ,   his   amiable   affectionate   temper ,   &   gentle manners   endeared   him   beyond   expression   to   all   who were   intimately   connected   with   him .   For   purity   and integrity   of   mind ,   tenderness   &   benevolence   of   disposition , &   gentleness   of   manners ,   I   n'ere   shall   look   upon   his   like again .   My   concern   for   what   my   Lord   Primate   will   feel   on   ye loss   of   so   beloved   &   so   worthy   a   Brother   is   very   great ,   and I   fear   his   affliction   will   be   aggravated   by   his   Publick   duties having   prevented   his   being   with   Sr   William   this Summer ,   while   the   poor   Man   was   in   bad   health .   I   never saw   two   Brothers   who   seem d   so   affectionate   to   each   other It   seems   hard   that   two   such   Friends   should   part   without taking   leave ,   for   melancholly   as   is   ye   moment   of   farewell on   reflection   it   adminsters   a   kind   of   consolation .   Sr Williams   patience   &   resignation   as   health   &   strength decreased   renderd   his   condition   almost   enviable .   I had   a   letter   from   him   but     days   before   he   expired ,   in which   he   gently   intimates   his   having   no   hope   of recovery ,   but   his   thankfulness   to   God   for   the   long   life he   had   enjoy d ,   the   many   blessings   he   had   received , &   ye   perfect   resignation   to   ye   divine   Will   made   one sensible   that   ye   sting   of   death   is   Sin   &   that   the   truly religious   &   Virtuous   Man   sees   his   dissolution   approach without   any   pertubation   of   mind . Montagu   had   a   letter   from   Mrs   Alison   yesterday   which gave   us   ye   pleasure   of   hearing   she   &   her   little   Girl   were in   good   health .   Her   youngest   Brother   Mr   William Gregory ,   who   had   a   Curacy   in   this   part   of   the   World , spent   a   day   with   us   last   week ,   he   left   us   on   tuesday morning ,   being   then   in   a   hurry   to   prepare   for   his journey   to   Sudborough .   We   are   all   very   sorry   that   he has   left   ye   Neighborhood   but   the   Person   to   whom   he was   Curate   intends   now   to   reside   at   his   Benefice   & do   ye   duty   himself . I   hope   Lady   Clermont   is   return d   to   England   as   I   see by   ye   news   papers   her   Lord   is   come   back . I   do   not   wonder   you   were   delighted   with   Devonshire House .   I   was   charmd   with   it   when   I   saw   it   &   I imagine   it   has   been   improved   &   embellishd   since that   time .   I   hope   Lady   Spencer   will   make   Mr   Poyntz a   visit   when   the   Dss   of   Devonshire   is   quite   well   again This   wish   is   a   little   interested   as   I   may   hope   to   catch   a   glimpse of   her   Ladyship ,   &   indeed   she   herself   will   find   infinite   pleasure in   seeing   her   charming   Neices   &   Nephews .   the   three   young Ladies   are   not   only   beautiful   &   lovely   in   their   Persons ,   but most   amiable   in   their   dispositions ;   &   their   manners   are so   polite ,   modest ,   &   engaging ,   they   would   adorn   a   Royal drawing   room ,   or   by   their   innocence   &   humility   bless   an humble   habitation .   Mrs   Poyntz   is   a   most   attentive   Mother , &   has   formed   their   characters   on   the   true   principles   of religion   &   morality ;   &   as   she   lives   in   retirement ,   the young   Ladies   have   not   been   left   to   a   pert   superficial affected   thing   call d   a   Governante .   Mrs   Poyntz   eldest   Son who   is   at   Eton   did   us   ye   favour   to   dine   with   us   one day ,   we   were   charmed   with   his   good   sense   &   elegant propriety   of   behaviour ,   &   he   is   very   handsome ,   &   ye   youngest Son ,   to   whom   I   have   ye   honour   to   be   Godmother ,   is   by   far the   finest   &   most   sensible   child   of   his   age   I   ever   saw .   If   you can   represent   to   yourself   a   little   urchin   who   has   ye   archness of   a   Cupid ,   &   ye   good   humourd   &   open   Countenance   of   a   Cherubim   you   may have   some   idea   of   him .   I   have   recommended   him   to   Mrs   M: Montagu   as   a   pattern   boy ,   but   I   do   not   find   she   is   in so   great   a   hurry   upon   that   subject   as   Doctor   Douglas . I   should   be   very   desirious ,   whenever   there   was   proper opportunity ,   to   do   him   any   service ;   but   the   recommendation of   an   Accoucheur ,   or   Accouchense ,   must   come   from the   relations   of   ye   Lady ,   &   as   Mrs   M:   Montagu's   Mother dyed   in   Childbed   of   her   first   Child ,   I   wd   not   for   ye   World meddle   in   ye   affair .   indeed   my   anxieties   wd   be   more than   enough   for   this   sweet   young   Woman .   I   should   be   very glad   to   have   a   grandchild ,   but   am   not   impatient   for any   good   which   must   be   purchased   by   her   suffering ,   or danger .

There   are   many   things   which   I   have   heard   people advised   to   lay   by   for   a   rainy   day ,   I   hope   you   will   do   so by   this   letter ,   for   it   wd   be   pity   you   shd   withdraw   yr attention   from   a   pleasant   World   to   give   it   to   such   dullness ; but   with   whatever   stupidity   of   head   I   may   write , be   assured   that   with   ye   greatest   sensibility   of   heart ,   & vivacity   of   affection ,   I   am   my   dear   Sylphs Most   faithfull   Friend &   Obedt   Hble   Servant E Montagu

BC_178x_EMONTAGU_FR	Dear   Madam Your   conversation   gave   me   so much   pleasure   when   you   did   me   the   honour   to   dine with   me ,   that   I   have   greatly   regretted   unavoidable engagements   have   prevented   my   waiting   on   you ,   &   solliciting a   repetition   of   that   favour .   I   cannot   guess   what   you mean   by   yr   having   been   guilty   of   an   impropriety .   I am   sure   I   never   then ,   nor   at   any   time ,   ever   saw   you do   or   say   any   thing   but   what   was   both   proper ,   &   highly   agreable . My   eyes   have   been   affected   by   a   cold ,   so   I   have   not read   all   ye   aphorisms .   Those   which   appeard   to   me hardly   worthy   to   accompany   your   work   I   have   markd . I   hope   soon   to   have   it   in   my   power   to   wait   on   you &   we   may   then   talk   over   this   matter .   I   have   returnd the   aphorisms   by   yr   Servant .   I   am   dear   Madam yr   most   Obliged Hble   Servt E Montagu Mrs   Reynolds 
BC_1790_EMONTAGU_SS	  ? My   very   dear   Sister I   believe   many   of   our   Sex   feel   greater   mortification at   being   arrived   at   the   age   at   which   Men   cease   to   flatter   them than   at   any   other   effect   of   years ;   but   to   you ,   truth   can   never say   displeasing   things .   I   am   rejoyced   to   find   you   are   recovering   from a   state   of   languor ,   for   tho   not   a   dangerous ,   or   painfull ,   it   is   an   uncomfortable condition .   &   to   have   found   your   good   Friend   at   Caister   in improving   health   must   have   raised   your   spirits .   I   am   sorry   he is   not   likely   to   undertake   a   journey   to   London ,   there   are   many interesting   objects   in   the   Capital   of   our   Country ,   &   the   improved elegance   &   magnificence ,   the   signs   of   increased   opulence ,   &   effects of   Peace   &   plenty ,   would   give   him   heartfelt   pleasure .   To   make   him the   best   amends   in   my   power   for   not   beholding   my   Phiz ,   I   have got   him   a   Print   which   except     the   original   is   the   homeliest   object he   can   cast   his   eyes   upon ,   &   I   shall   deliver   it   to   Miss   Arnold   on Monday   next ,   to   present   to   him   when   she   goes   to   Callon ,   it   was taken   from   My   Lord   Primates   Portrait   of   me   done   by   Sr   Joshua   Reynolds . If   it   should   shock   Mr   Freeman   I   desire   your   apothecary   to   make   its apology . My   Friends   have   carried   me   last   tuesday   to   see   a     Gun   ship   launched , it   was   the   most   magnificent   object   ever   formed   by   Man ,   it had   been     years   building ,   &   it   is   manned   by     Sailors ,   &   the   number of   Spectators   was   in   proportion   to   the   Grandeur   of   the   Spectacle but   as   Montagu   got   us   Seats   in   Lord   Chatham   box   we   did   not suffer   any   inconvenience ;   but   sat   in   a   Booth   on   the   Shore   contemplating all   the   glories   of   Father   Thames ,   Commercial   Vessels   passing while   the   proud   Ship   of   War   was   preparing   to   protect   them   from   the insults   of   their   Enemies .   Lord   Belgrave ,   one   of   the   Lords   of   the   Admiralty came   home   with   us   &   dined   here .   I   hope   the   Spaniards   will   not persist   in   their   bravery . Mrs   Boscawen   &   her   Sister   Mrs   Price   &   Miss   Price ,   &   Mrs   Levinson dined   with   us   on   thursday .   On   monday   we   are   to   dine   with Mr   &   Mrs   Raikes ,   where   I   shall   have   the   pleasure   of   meeting Miss   Arnold   &   Miss   Bowdler I   can   with   pleasure   tell   you   it   is   thought   Mr   Pitt   will   have   more   Friends   in   this   than   he   had   in   the   last   Parliament ,   &   if   by his   spirited   preparations   he   awes   the   Spaniards   to   submission , which   there   is   much   reason   to   hope ,   he   will   tip   the   Olive   with more   glory   than   the   laurels   bear . As   reflection   of   purse   is   dangerous   to   the   mind   as   reflection   of   blood &   humours   to   ye   body ,   Miss   Vannick   has   taken   good   measures to   prevent   it . Lady   Valletort   to   ye   mortification   of   ye   Mountedgemonte   family has   brought   forth   a   dead   Child .   I   am   grieved   such   good   Parents , &   a   happy   Pair ,   shd   have   had   so   great   a   disappointment . I   hope   Ld   Stanhope   &   his   Crew   will   only   disgrace themselves ,   &   not   disturb   their   Country . The   late   Ld   Hardwickes   Executors   sent   me   a   mourning   ring which   I   take   as   a   great   compliment   I   suppose   in   consequence of   his   Lordships   having   put   up   my   Portrait   at   Wimpole ; he   made   Mr   Sloane   copy   of   it   from   one   done   for   Sr   Wm Robinson ;   he   placed   it   in   company   with   Persons   with   whom my   very   small   merits   had   little   pretensions   to   rank .   I have   had   a   very   obliging   invitation   from   the   present Lord   &   Lady   Hardwick   to   make   one   in   a   visit   my   young Friends   have   promised   them   a   few   days   hence   ,   but   I   grow too   old   for   excursions .   My   health   has   been   uninterrupted ,   but My   eyes   are   very   weak   to   day ,   owing   to ,   I   believe ,   the   damp Weather .   Last   night   we   had   terrible   wind   &   rain ,   &   ye   rains continue   very   violent . On   friday   next   I   propose   to   sleep   at   Mrs   Boscawens   at   Beckmond   , &   on   Saturday   to   get   to   Sandleford ,   &   I   hope   this   family   will   soon follow   me   thither . There   are   terrible   commotions   at   Lyons ,   &   the   wiser   heads   at Paris   shout   ye   Government   no   nearer   a   settlement   than it   was   this   time   twelve   months . It   is   thought   our   Parle   will   not   meet   ye   .   I   hope   they will   not   assemble   till   Winter . Accept   ye   affectionate   respects   of   this   family . I   am   my   dear   Sister yr   most   affectte   &   Obliged E M All   here   in   perfect   health

I have   sent   ye   great   Commoner   to   wait   on   you , as   for   me   I   am   quite   alone   at   present ,   but   I   did not   intend   to   peruse   this   notable   pamphlet which   was   given   my   by   the   Author ,   who   seems to   be   much   pleased   with   it ,   but   as   that   is   poor security   for   the   reader ,   I   have   sent   you   a   new french   play .   My   best   respects   attend   Lady   Primrose . I   had   a   note   from   Mrs   Carter   this   morning   she longs   for   a   vision   of   ye   Sylph .

I   was   going   to   send   you some   artificial   flowers   I   have   now   sent   you   ye   natural flowers   of   eloquence .   The   business   of   ye   House   of   Commons yesterday   was   considering   ye   report   of   what   they   did the   day   before ,   they   divided   again   ye   ayes     /   No¥s it   seems   ye   opposers   had   summon d   all   their   forces but they   must   call   in   their   friends   the   mob   if they   mean   to   have   a   majority . yrs 
BC_17xx_EMONTAGU_EV_11	To   Mrs   Vesey I   wish   Monsey   was   hanged ,   &   then embowell'd   &   stuff'd   with   rhubarb ,   a   poor   dogged   witt , who   has   no   goût   for   the   Epich ,   is   determined   to   keep away   the   son   of   the   song   from   our   feast   of   shells !   I   am convinced   that   your   note   will   bring   Ossian   himself , &   he   will   play   upon   Aolus's   harp   while   we   are   at dinner ,   the   vulgar   will   think   it   is   the   wind ,   but   we shall   know   it   is   the   bard   of   Morven .   I   could   have made   a   rhubarb   tart   for   Mr   Vesey ,   &   have   put   a   good custard   upon   it ,   a   better   preparation   than   Monseys , who   in   the   bitterness   of   his   jealousy   has   given   this untimely   dose .   I   depend   on   seeing   my   Dear   Mrs Vesey ,   &   I   hope   that   will   break   ye   Doctors   heart . I   know   it   is   a   hard   heart ,   but   it   may   therefore be   the   more   brittle .   it   would   please   me   as   well   if he   would   break   his   neck ,   &   no   bard   shd   raise   the song   on   his   tomb ,   but   apes   should   go   in ,   &   monkeys chatter ,   &   magpyes   talk ,   &   all   the   half   witts   in   nature haunt   it .   his   name   should   never   be   written   but   in   an anagram   of   an   acoustick   which   witting ,   shd   whistle through   the   void   of   sense   &   reason   till   monsters   caught   ye   sound

I   am not   positively   ill   but   I   am   a   whimsy   animal ,   &   so much   so   it   is   an   uncivil   but   eternal   truth   to   say I   am   yours   E M

BC_17xx_EMONTAGU_EV_8	Mr   Montagu   went   out   before   I   was   up   &   expects ye   hour   of   dining   with   me   .   I   shd   like   to   thrust   my   nose   into ye   tête   a   tête   of   a   Sylph   &   an   Athenian   maid .   I   wonder what   lingo   they   talk .   Thank   me   for   not   saying   gibberish . I   did   for   you   what   one   friend   has   often   done   for another .   I   wrote   a   billet   doux   to   yr   Husband   in yr   absence .   I   bid   him   call   all   ye   philosophers   in Europe   about   him .   alass   unlucky   Mortal   that   I   am   that I   cannot   dine   with   yr   divinityships !

BC_17xx_EMONTAGU_EV_9	On   tuesday   &   thursday   I   am   yours ,   if   your wishes   never   take   a   better   aim   than   at   my   company   you are   not   in   danger   of   a   disappointment .   But   pray   Madam who   told   you   I   may   be   satisfied   with   one   Peer ?   I   think   if you   had   been   any   thing   friendly   you   might   have   askd my   Lord   Cardigan   &   Lady   Betty   Montagu ,   which   wd   save appearances ,   &   no   Lady   minds   saving   any   thing more   in   this   age .   I   mean   this   for   thursday .   I   am   not much   afraid   of   a   golden   chain   where   there   is   plenty   of gold   in   a   better   form ;   &   I   believe   most   who   have   worn them ,   own   that   gold   chains   are   very   heavy   tho   not   quite so   galling   as   of   baser   &   ruder   metal . Ever   yrs I   will   bring   Mrs   Carter   on   tuesday &   if   you   please   also   on   thursday   take   ye   good   preacher   in Chaucer   letting   down   the   golden   chain   on   high , she   lifts   her   hearers   upwards   to   ye   sky .   The   links   of her   harmony   will   put   my   Lady   Mayoress's   chain   out of   countenance
